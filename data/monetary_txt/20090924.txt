Factors that may impede this rebalancing would need
to be addressed. Global imbalances have narrowed sharply after
the crisis, reflecting some painful corrections and cyclical factors
(see chart).4
 However, imbalances—based on current policy trajectories—are projected to
widen again, signaling the need for further underlying adjustment. A number of distortions
keep saving high in key surplus countries; and problems with the international monetary
system continue to prompt self insurance in some countries through large reserve
accumulation, especially after the crisis.
