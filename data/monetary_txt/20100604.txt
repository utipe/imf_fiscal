Fast-growing advanced and emerging economies can start tightening policies now.
For some countries, using fiscal policy to contain demand pressures may be
preferable if tighter monetary conditions risk exacerbating pressures from capital
inflows. Elsewhere, however, in some other countries where debt levels are relatively
low, monetary tightening and exchange rate adjustment would be more appropriate
than fiscal tightening.
