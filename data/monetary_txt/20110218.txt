Repair and reform of financial systems—critical to the normalization of credit conditions
in several countries and to prevent contagion—needs to be accelerated. Concern about
asset values and risky exposures should be addressed by forcing banks to build capital
buffers, while unviable business models need to be unwound. This would help reduce the
burden on monetary and fiscal policy to support the recovery, and minimize the real
consequences of deleveraging. In this context, the new round of EU-wide stress test
should be transparent, sufficiently stringent, and accompanied by contingent plans for
quick recapitalization or resolution of banks to reassure markets.
With inflationary expectations well anchored, accommodative monetary policy in
major advanced economies remains appropriate for now. High unemployment and large
output gaps are keeping wages and inflation expectations in the major advanced economies in
check, notwithstanding large increases in food and energy prices. Continuing monetary policy
accommodation is thus the right policy from a domestic perspective, considering also that the
recovery is expected to remain sluggish going forward. From an external perspective, however,
there is concern that quantitative easing in the United States could result in a flood of capital. In
economies where recovery is already well established, policymakers will need to pay increasing
attention to building inflationary pressure. Central banks should continue to stand ready to
address liquidity problems in the banking sector, particularly in the euro area.
