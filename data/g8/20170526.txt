Global recovery is gaining momentum, yet growth remains moderate and GDP is still below potential in many countries, with the balance of risks tilted to the downside. Our top priority is to raise global growth to deliver higher living standards and quality jobs. To this end, we reaffirm our commitment to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. In particular, monetary policy should continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability, consistently with central banks' mandate. We concur that fiscal policy should be used flexibly to strengthen growth and job creation, while also enhancing inclusiveness and ensuring that debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. In doing so, we agree on the importance of improving the quality of public finances, including by prioritizing high-quality investment, such as in infrastructures. We remain committed to advancing structural reforms to boost productivity and potential output, while ensuring these are appropriately coordinated with macroeconomic policies. We reaffirm our existing G7 exchange rate commitments, as agreed upon by Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors at their meeting in Bari. We will strive to reduce excessive global imbalances and in a way that supports global growth. We commit to tackling all forms of corruption and tax evasion, as a means of reinforcing public trust in governments and fostering sustainable global growth.
