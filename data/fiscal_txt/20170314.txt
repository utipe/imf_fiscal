EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global economy is showing more positive momentum. The WEO January update projects global
growth at 3.4 in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018, up from 3.1 percent in 2016. While many advanced economies
still experience demand shortfalls and core inflation below target, the outlook has generally improved,
helped by a notable cyclical upturn in global manufacturing and trade, and the expectation of a more
expansionary U.S. fiscal policy. The growth forecast has been slightly revised down for emerging economies,
due to tighter financial conditions in the wake of a stronger U.S. dollar and higher global interest rates.
The outlook could easily change depending on the policies that materialize. The baseline forecast
assumes that: U.S. fiscal policy unfolds broadly as anticipated while the Federal Reserve continues to
normalize gradually in line with economic developments; China manages its transition well; and there are
no major policy disruptions to trade and investment, including from Brexit negotiations. There are upside
risks to the outlook in the near term—for example, if cyclical forces or growth support in the United States
or China exceed expectations—but the opposite also holds.
The balance of risks remains asymmetric and is skewed to the downside. Concern has risen about
adverse—and often neglected—side effects of global economic integration and technology change on jobs
and income distribution in advanced economies. Political pressures to reverse these trends could lead to
inward-looking policies that disrupt global trade, harming growth without materially aiding those harmed
by structural economic transformations. Beyond this risk, a sharp tightening in financial conditions could
trigger greater capital outflows from emerging markets; lingering financial and fiscal stability concerns in
some advanced economies could become acute; and geopolitical problems could intensify.
Longer-term prospects for advanced economies as well as commodity exporters remain subdued. In
several economies, high corporate debt still impedes investment, while high levels of non-performing loans
and weak bank profitability constrain the credit supply. These legacies weaken economic resilience and
exacerbate the impact of longer-term trends that hold back growth, especially in advanced economies, such
as weak infrastructure and business investment, slowing innovation, and aging. The adjustment of
commodity exporters to lower prices continues. The weakening of the commitment, in some countries, to a
multilateral trade framework endangers a critical source of global productivity growth and resilience.
Policymakers hold the key to a stronger, more resilient, and fairer global economy. The right policies
will support growth, safeguard economic integration, and ensure gains are broadly shared within countries:

Reinforcing the growth momentum. In advanced economies with demand shortfalls, monetary support
is still needed. For countries with fiscal space, fiscal policies should also play an active role in supporting
growth, structural reforms, and balance sheet repair. In countries closer to capacity, fiscal policy should
focus on raising longer-term growth potential, including through targeted infrastructure investment.
Boosting demand would also help to reduce excess current account surpluses where these are present.
Even where fiscal space is limited, public revenues and expenditures can be made more growth-friendly.
Sharing gains more equitably. Longer-term growth comes from innovation, technological advances, and
an efficient allocation of production factors through economic exchange. To ensure gains are shared
widely within countries, more must be done to help those suffering adverse side effects—for example,
through education and ensuring that the tax-benefit system is both equitable and growth-friendly.
Strengthening resilience and long-term growth. Where still needed, balance sheet repair will support
resilience and help sustain the recovery. Emerging markets should continue to allow exchange rates to
buffer shocks while addressing vulnerabilities. Structural reforms, well-targeted to country needs, will
raise potential growth, which could also help create much-needed future fiscal space.
Working together. A strong, rules-oriented multilateral trade framework maximizes the benefits from
global integration and safeguards against risks, including from distortive domestic policies that are
collectively self-defeating. International cooperation will safeguard trade as an engine of growth and
ensure its gains are broadly shared; help adjust policies to redress global imbalances; strengthen
regulatory and resolution frameworks; and bolster the global financial safety net. It is also indispensable
to implementing a level playing field in international taxation and tackling climate change. International
cooperation should provide an adequate forum to discuss and resolve differences.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
Near-term global growth is expected to pick up, reflecting a firming-up of activity in advanced
economies, an anticipated shift in the macroeconomic policy mix in the United States, and stabilization
in stressed emerging economies. The outlook is also surrounded by larger than usual uncertainty, with
risks tilted to the downside, as the economic policy assumptions underpinning the outlook could easily
change and contribute to significant financial market volatility. Notwithstanding the positive
momentum, structural headwinds and persistent crisis legacies continue to hold back growth in the
medium term, especially in advanced economies. There is also a threat that concerns in advanced
economies about negative side effects of global economic integration and technology change, including
impacts on jobs in some sectors and inequality, could lead to inward-looking policies that disrupt global
economic integration and harm growth.

SOLID NEAR-TERM GROWTH MOMENTUM

High frequency indicators point to a pick-up in global growth. Growth outturns in the
second half of 2016 and manufacturing and confidence indicators suggest solid near-term
momentum. The WEO January update projects global growth to

The outlook has improved in advanced economies. Growth
prospects appear to be firming up in Japan and the euro area,
on the back of a cyclical recovery in global manufacturing:
growth was stronger than anticipated in the second half of 2016,
and high-frequency indicators of manufacturing activity suggest
continued growth momentum in 2017. The level of economic
activity remains significantly below potential in a number of
economies, however, including France, Italy, and Korea. Growth
in the United Kingdom has also been stronger than expected in
the aftermath of the Brexit vote—underpinned by solid private
consumption.

policy mix and an uptick in confidence. Fiscal policy under the new administration is expected to
turn more expansionary—with the bulk of the impulse likely materializing in 2018 and through
revenue side measures—while monetary policy is seen as continuing to normalize gradually in
line with economic developments. Provided the tightening of global financial conditions
associated with higher U.S. interest rates and a rising U.S. dollar remains contained, and depending
on the balance of other policy initiatives in the United States, higher U.S. growth could have
positive growth spillovers on much of the rest of the world. Emerging and developing economies
with exchange rates pegged to the dollar or with large dollar liabilities could, however, face
challenges.


Emerging economies remain the main driver of the strengthening global outlook, though growth
prospects differ across countries. In China, the near-term growth momentum has strengthened
based on continued policy support and excessively fast credit growth. Looking ahead, the
economy is expected to continue its transition to a slower and more sustainable growth path that
is increasingly reoriented away from exports and investment toward consumption. In India, growth
is expected to pick up once the effects of cash shortages linked to the currency exchange initiative
fade. Growth in Brazil is expected to return to positive territory in 2017, even though impaired
public and private sector balance sheets are slowing the pace of the recovery. In Mexico, the
outlook has weakened as uncertainty about future trade relations with the United States weighs
on confidence. Russia is expected to return to positive growth, in part helped by higher oil prices.

strengthening consumer confidence, positive macroeconomic data,
and the expectation of a U.S. fiscal stimulus. In emerging economies,
post-election non-resident portfolio outflows have mostly reversed
and equity markets have recovered, but financial conditions remain
tighter, especially in some vulnerable economies. At the same time,

countries. In Mexico concerns about future trade relations with the United States weigh on the
currency and financing costs. The British pound has depreciated amid increased uncertainty regarding
future trade relations between the United Kingdom and European Union. And more recently, the
spread between German long-term government bond yields and some other parts of the euro area
has increased notably, in part reflecting elevated political risks.
4.
Global imbalances moderated recently, but could widen again in the coming years.
Preliminary data suggest a marginal narrowing of global external imbalances in 2016. For example,
while Germany’s current account surplus further widened slightly, current account balances declined
in other creditor countries such as China and fuel exporters, and improved in some debtor countries,
including in the euro area. However, imbalances could start widening again, as the projected fiscal
expansion in the United States would boost domestic demand and lead to a higher current account
deficit. Exchange rate movements also point in this direction, in particular the real effective
appreciation of the U.S. dollar (by about five percent since August 2016) and the weakening of the
euro and the Japanese yen. In emerging markets, recent currency developments have been mixed,
with a sharp appreciation of the Russian ruble on the back of increasing oil prices and depreciations
of the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira.

UNDERLYING POLICY ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS
5.
The outlook could easily change should policy outcomes depart from the paths that we
assume. Specifically, the projected short-term growth momentum builds in near-term U.S. fiscal
stimulus accompanied by a gradual, data-driven monetary policy normalization. While this policy
expectation is broadly in line with market views, actual policies and their domestic and international
impacts could differ widely based on the size, composition, and duration of the fiscal expansion. For
example, with the U.S. economy operating near full employment, a focus on infrastructure spending
and efficiency-enhancing corporate tax reform would gradually expand its underlying capacity along
with demand. Anchored in a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to bring down the rising sovereign
debt-to-GDP ratio, this would result in a more sustained growth impact—as well as better debt
dynamics—than an increase in non-productive spending. The outlook also assumes that China effects
a well-managed transition toward slower and more sustainable growth by gradually reducing its
reliance on credit stimulus while avoiding an abrupt adjustment of debt overhangs. Another key
assumption is the absence of policy-induced significant disruptions to trade and investment.
6.
Unusually high policy uncertainty adds significant downside skew to an already negative
risk balance. While there is some potential for upside surprises to near-term growth—for example, if
the underlying cyclical forces surprised on the upside, or if policy action in the United States or China
turns out to be more ambitious or effective than expected—the opposite holds as well. Overall, the
downside bias of potential risks has risen, especially over the medium term, and a sharp rise in risk
aversion remains a possibility.


Fragmentation of trade and capital flows. The threat of inward-looking protectionist measures has
increased. This development has been fueled by concerns in advanced economies about

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

disruptive side effects of trade on jobs and the income distribution; a perception that migration
is having a negative impact on domestic populations; and increased refugee flows—even though
there are indications that technology advances have had a greater impact on workers’ dislocations
and increases in income inequality than economic integration. Heightened restrictions on trade
or capital movement would hamper international trade, disrupt the operation of global value
chains, deter investment, and reduce productivity. The restrictions would not, however, give much
help to those harmed by the advance of trade and technology. Instead, they would hurt overall
income growth and raise the cost of living, hitting those in lower income brackets especially hard.
Unilateral actions would likely trigger retaliation by others, leaving all countries worse off.


Severe capital outflows from emerging markets. Global financial conditions could tighten faster
than expected, for example, because of a faster rise in interest rates in the United States driven by
inflationary pressures. In such a scenario, emerging economies with high public and/or private
nonfinancial sector debt, weak bank balance sheets, and depleted policy buffers would be
particularly vulnerable to capital flow reversals, tighter financial conditions, and sharp movements
in major currencies. So would those with currency pegs to the U.S. dollar.



Balance sheet weaknesses in some euro area countries. Failure to make sufficient progress in
implementing the necessary reforms to address the overhang of non-performing loans would
hold back growth, including by constraining the supply of credit. In addition, financial stability
risks could rise, notably in countries where low profitability, high debt and poor asset quality
continue to stress the banking sector. If unaddressed, these problems could interact with higher
political risks to reignite financial stability concerns.



A sudden severe slowdown in China. A failure to adjust macroeconomic policies from their current
loose stance and a lack of decisive reform would increase vulnerabilities—given high and rapidly
rising debt, impaired corporate balance sheets, and the increasingly large, opaque and
interconnected financial sector. Delay of the necessary rebalancing could result in a more
disruptive and sharper-than-expected slowdown. Such an abrupt downshift could have sizable
spillovers to the rest of the world through trade, commodity price, and confidence channels.



Geopolitical risks and other noneconomic factors. Heightened domestic and external political
tensions; acts of terrorism; contagious diseases, such as the spread of the Zika virus; ongoing
climate change; and refugee flows continue to weigh on the outlook in several regions. Intensified
geopolitical tensions and terrorism could take an economic toll quickly by harming global
economic confidence.

A DIFFICULT LONGER-TERM OUTLOOK
7.
Notwithstanding the expected improvement in economic activity, growth prospects
over the medium term remain subdued for advanced economies and commodity exporters. In
advanced economies, medium-term growth rates of GDP (per capita or in the aggregate) are expected
to remain lower than their historical average by about ¾ percentage points. In a number of emerging
economies, especially those negatively affected by still low commodity price levels, medium-term

growth prospects are also weak. And while projected per capita growth rates for emerging Asia over
the medium term are generally buoyant, they hinge crucially on the assumption that strong policies
are being implemented, underlining the possibility of large downside risks.

also seem to have played a role.
10.
The recent political backlash in advanced economies against the rules-oriented
multilateral trade framework poses a threat to a critical source of global productivity growth.
Technology advances and trade are part of the engine that creates productivity growth and have
resulted in significant improvements in global welfare. They interact in generating productivity
improvements and spreading them: trade raises productivity by fostering efficient country
specialization, giving access to more varied and higher quality inputs, spreading technological
progress, and enhancing competition and technological innovation. In turn, technology advances—in
particular in the area of communications and transports—have facilitated trade. Restrictions to trade
would slow down technology advances and productivity growth more generally, hurting all.

POLICIES
Choosing the right economic policies is the key to sustaining stronger growth, improving economic
resilience, and ensuring that the gains from growth are broadly shared. With demand shortfalls in many
countries and a generalized weakness in productivity growth trends, policymakers need to provide the
right combination of demand support and structural policies, while exploiting synergies between them.
To make sure that the gains from growth are shared widely within each country, it remains critical to
support those who have to adjust to technological progress and global economic integration. Structural
reforms should aim at boosting productivity, strengthening the financial system, and capitalizing on the
gains from economic integration. A strong, rules-oriented multilateral framework remains vital to
maximize the benefits of global economic integration, avoid the inefficiencies of zero-sum national
policy approaches, and safeguard against risks.

REINFORCING THE GROWTH MOMENTUM
11.
Reinforcing the growth momentum requires the right mix of demand support and
supply reforms. In those advanced economies where inflation remains below target, a supportive
monetary policy stance should be maintained, relying on unconventional measures, as needed—for
example in the euro area and Japan. In the United States, monetary policy normalization should
continue to be gradual and data driven. In economies operating close to full capacity (such as the
United States and Germany), any fiscal support should be oriented toward increasing potential output,
for instance through investment in high-quality infrastructure, including social infrastructure such as
education, health, or childcare. In Germany, higher public investment would also contribute to
reducing the very high current account balance surplus. In economies with insufficient demand but
available fiscal space, fiscal policy can support short-term growth while also focusing on boosting the
supply potential of the economy. Emerging economies face starkly diverse cyclical positions, but the
emphasis should generally be on enhancing resilience (as discussed below).
12.
Exploiting synergies between short-term support and structural reforms is even more
crucial where fiscal space is limited and monetary policy operates close to the effective lower
bound. In such cases the combination of temporary macroeconomic support—well-anchored by
credible medium-term policy frameworks—with growth-enhancing structural reforms can deliver
more than the sum of its parts.2 In countries where fiscal adjustment is needed, consolidation should
be gradual and as growth-friendly as possible, while structural reforms should prioritize lower-cost
measures that could have a beneficial impact on public finances over the medium term.

SHARING THE GAINS FROM GROWTH
13.
Policies should ensure that the gains from growth are more broadly shared. Some of the
drivers of medium- and longer-term growth can also impact the distribution of income. For example,
2

comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated approach to economic policy,” IMF Staff Discussion Note 16/09.

technological change or trade might let certain sectors grow while shrinking others, forcing the
burden of adjustment predominantly on households that are—occupationally or geographically—less
mobile. While global economic integration is but one of the forces at work, a combination of job
losses for less adaptable workers, higher income inequality, and weak income growth—especially for
low- and median-income earners—can feed a political climate that favors inward-looking policies.
This creates a danger of responding to well-justified equity concerns with protectionist policies that
ultimately hurt growth, welfare, and the economy’s flexibility and resilience. Against this backdrop,
policies should be carefully designed to preserve the gains from economic integration while also
supporting those who need to adjust to it. Important levers for policy action include:


Providing support to those adversely affected. Short-run measures to help the adjustment of those
affected comprise active labor market policies to ease mobility in the labor market and social
safety nets, like unemployment insurance and other “passive” labor market policies. In the longer
run, ensuring adequate education and skills training (including through lifelong learning), policies
to facilitate mobility such as housing, credit access and infrastructure, and regional-based
policies—for example, targeting low-skilled workers in geographic regions that are affected by
automation and outsourcing—are also necessary.



Income policies and tax-benefit systems. Income policies (such as in-work tax incentives and higher
minimum wages where they are too low) and changes to tax-benefit systems (including more
progressive income taxation) can, in addition to encouraging participation, also help ensure that
the gains from growth are more widely shared at the national level. Effective social safety nets,
including access to portable healthcare and pensions, will also support inclusiveness as well as
worker mobility.



Ensuring a level playing field. This set of policies can include an array of measures, such as fostering
competition, lowering barriers to entrepreneurship, cracking down on tax evasion, promoting
financial inclusion, and preventing business practices that shift profits to low-tax locations.



Facilitating the integration of immigrants. Labor market integration is critical to enhance the
contribution of migrants to host countries and promote social cohesion. While avoiding a possible
overburdening of social systems, policymakers should deploy active policies such as language
training and assistance in job search, better recognition of migrants’ skills through credential
systems, and support for migrant entrepreneurship.

STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE AND LONG-TERM GROWTH
14.
Corporate and bank balance sheet repair are a pre-condition for sustaining growth and
increasing resilience. Several advanced European economies, especially, need to accelerate banks’
balance sheet repair and the resolution of non-performing loans, including through a combination of
greater supervisory encouragement, insolvency reform, and the development of secondary markets
for distressed debt. This process would boost credit, investment, and ultimately productivity, including
through improvements in business dynamism and efficiency gains in the allocation of capital across
firms. Measures to safeguard banking sector stability and profitability in a context of persistent low
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

growth and interest rates are also a priority. In some emerging economies, reducing excessive
corporate leverage and improving banks’ balance sheets (for example in China and India), or adopting
more prudent risk-management practices—including to reduce currency and maturity balance sheet
mismatches—will help reduce vulnerabilities to global financial conditions, possible capital outflows,
and sharp currency movements.
15.
In emerging economies, maintaining macroeconomic stability and rebuilding policy
buffers will be important to reduce vulnerability to a tightening of global financial conditions.
Where exchange rates are not pegged, they can act as a crucial buffer against economic and financial
shocks, provided exposure from foreign-currency denominated debt is limited. Commodity exporters
such as Saudi Arabia, despite the relief provided by the recent firming of commodity prices, need to
adjust to the new lower price environment by continuing to adjust fiscal policy in as growth-friendly
a way as possible and diversifying their economies. In China, macroeconomic policies should be
adjusted to ensure the transition to a slower and more sustainable growth path, while efforts to
contain financial stability risks should be intensified. This includes moving away from unsustainably
high growth targets, efforts to address debt overhang and to slow credit expansion, switching from
off-budget investment to more on-budget, pro-consumption measures, as well as strengthening
transparency, especially in communicating policy objectives and enhancing data quality. In India, the
fiscal deficit is expected to continue narrowing in the near-term; however, further subsidy reduction
and tax reforms, including a robust design and full implementation of the goods and services tax, are
necessary to attain medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. Delivering on fiscal consolidation and
debt sustainability is essential to maintain market confidence in Brazil and Mexico, while Argentina
should also continue with fiscal consolidation in line with the authorities’ medium-term targets.
16.
In addition, structural reforms remain crucial to tackle the longer-term forces holding
back growth. With 2018 drawing closer, the G-20’s Brisbane ambition to raise its collective GDP by 2
percent above baseline seems increasingly out of reach. Achieving the envisaged output boost will
require quick implementation of the announced growth strategies. However, additional efforts to raise
productivity are needed, especially in advanced economies.
17.


These reforms will be most effective when tailored to country conditions:
One important factor is the level of development. For example, emerging economies tend to have
more room to improve the business environment, remove excessive regulations in services
sectors, and discourage informality, as well as to increase education levels and foster the adoption
of innovations. In advanced economies, the general priorities include strengthening innovation
and addressing population aging through measures aimed at raising labor force participation. In
this context, immigration can also play a role: migrants tend to be younger than natives, and
notwithstanding transition costs, IMF research shows that their presence can significantly increase
labor productivity and income per person in receiving economies in the longer term.3 These

positive effects stem from high-skilled as well as from lowerskilled immigration. Low-skilled immigrants complement the
capabilities of higher-skilled natives, filling up a whole range of
occupations for which natives are in short supply, and allow
natives to move to more complex occupations. Swift labor
market integration accelerates these gains, while raising
migrants’ net fiscal contributions.

Other reforms, such as employment protection reform and
unemployment benefit reform, are best implemented when demand is already strong, or when
fiscal and monetary policies can provide support.

18.
Structural reforms can also help create fiscal space. Recent IMF research suggests that
most labor and product market reforms have the potential to strengthen the public finances by raising
growth in the medium term. In addition, initial fiscal support tends to facilitate reforms and enhance
their impact on output and tax revenue by helping to alleviate transition and social costs and
improving demand conditions. This channel, in turn, can help reduce public debt burdens and create
fiscal space to support more reforms going forward.4

MULTILATERAL ACTION TO MAXIMIZE GAINS AND SAFEGUARD AGAINST RISKS
19.
The G-20 can promote multilateral solutions that maximize the gains from economic
integration and safeguard against global risks. A rules-oriented open multilateral trade framework
has brought significant benefits. Technology and economic integration have boosted incomes,
expanded access to tradable goods and services, and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.
Multilateral solutions are necessary to promote global trade and protect a level playing field, address
global imbalances, facilitate international regulatory reforms, and help strengthen the international
financial architecture. International cooperation should provide a forum to discuss and resolve
differences. Complemented by effective national policies to ensure that the gains from global
economic integration are shared widely within countries, this strategy can deliver global economic
integration that benefits all, while minimizing the risk of unilateral actions.
20.


Key elements of the global agenda include:
Multilateral efforts to address global imbalances. On the one hand, coordinated actions between
countries to boost growth can exploit synergies and amplify each other. On the other hand,
unsustainable policies in one country can spread easily to others through spillovers or contagion.

multilateral trade framework is vital in this regard, including avoiding protectionist measures as
well as distortive national macroeconomic and microeconomic policies that give rise to
competitive advantage. The IMF conducts a multilateral assessment of external imbalances in the
context of its Article IV consultations and its External Sector Report, identifying “excessive”
imbalances relative to a country-specific norm consistent with underlying fundamentals and
desirable policies. This assessment is updated on an annual basis.


Strengthening trade as a strong engine of broadly shared growth. Reducing trade costs and
deploying measures to roll back the recent increase in temporary trade barriers would help
support trade. The recent entry into force of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade
Facilitation Agreement is a welcome development in this respect. Regional trade agreements help
advance reforms in specific “frontier” areas, including services and digital trade, regulatory
cooperation, and policies toward FDI. Without similar advances at the global level, however, their
continued proliferation risks evolving into a system in which traditional trade matters are overseen
in the multilateral trading system, and regulatory and other frontier matters are negotiated
elsewhere.



Completing international financial regulatory reform. Outstanding challenges across advanced and
emerging economies include: finalizing global standards for banks; improving regulation and
oversight of financial institutions, including non-banks; ensuring regulators have the capacity to
resolve globally systemic financial institutions; and strengthening the resilience of central
counterparty clearing for derivatives.



Strengthening the international financial architecture. The highly interconnected international
financial system and the presence of excessive imbalances in some regions call for a more
coordinated and adequately resourced global financial safety net and stronger frameworks for the
prevention and resolution of debt crises.



Continuing support for low-income countries. Low income countries continue to face a challenging
environment, reflecting still-depressed commodity prices, moderate global growth, and in some
cases security issues and domestic political uncertainty. Strong policies and unwavering support
from the international community are needed to foster resilience, diversify economic structures,
and promote inclusiveness. These objectives have to be supported by steady progress in the
implementation of the sustainable development goals and the 2030 development agenda. In this
context, the G-20 Compact with Africa initiative provides a key framework for boosting private
and public investment.



Coordinating the response to non-economic challenges. The international community plays a crucial
role in fostering financial and other types of support for countries most affected by epidemics,
natural disasters, and armed conflicts. International cooperation to mitigate the effects of natural
disasters and adapt to climate change should also be enhanced.

Enhancing international cooperation on migration issues. Helpful progress could include better
cooperation between source and recipient countries, for example, by facilitating remittance flows,
better protecting labor rights, and promoting safer and more secure working environments for
migrants. Cooperation is also important to address challenges from involuntary migration,
including through effective assistance and resources for refugees wishing to return home.
