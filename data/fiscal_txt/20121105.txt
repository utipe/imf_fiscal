EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent policy actions have led to some easing in financial stress and economic conditions may be stabilizing.
Following actions by major central banks and EU governments, financial markets have experienced welcome respite
recently and there are signs that the pace of activity has picked up relative to the second quarter. Nonetheless, the
global economy remains vulnerable to new setbacks. In the euro area, activity remains weak, implementation
challenges are large, financial conditions remain fragile, and high funding costs in the periphery hinder their growth
and adjustment. Political impasse on dealing with large fiscal imbalances in the United States and Japan also
contributes to lack of clarity and weighs on business confidence. Meanwhile, activity in major emerging
economies—a main driver of global growth—has decelerated on the back of spillovers from advanced economies
and the unwinding of credit booms in some countries, but the extent is not fully known.
The outlook for growth remains weak with appreciable downside risks. Prospects are for a modest
reacceleration of global activity, provided policies are implemented decisively in the euro area and fiscal mistakes
are avoided in the United States. But downside risks remain considerable. Despite strong ECB actions, a reescalation of the euro area crisis remains a threat. Major risks also originate in the United States from the ―fiscal
cliff,‖ a looming debate on raising the debt ceiling, and the absence of an agreed-upon fiscal roadmap. Potential
growth may disappoint going forward in both advanced and emerging economies, reflecting the legacy of the
financial crisis in the former and the unwinding of credit booms in the latter. But growth could also be stronger if
policymakers acted promptly to further strengthen policies.
While progress has been made, resolving the euro area crisis will require timely and resolute policy
implementation. Access to funding at reasonable costs is essential to allow economies to adjust successfully.
Countries under pressure should implement adjustment plans and, if needed, request appropriate support from the
EFSF/ESM. This would allow the ECB to intervene by using the newly-established OMT framework. Where financial
conditions permit, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate. Anti-crisis measures should also be paired
with a clearer roadmap toward banking union and greater fiscal integration to strengthen EMU. Such a union
should rest on a single supervisory mechanism; a pan euro area resolution mechanism with common backstops; and
a pan euro area deposit guarantee scheme. Finally, continued implementation of structural, fiscal and financial
reforms, that will still take many years to complete, is essential.
Fiscal consolidation in advanced economies should proceed in a sustained and gradual manner, while central
banks should stand ready to do more if needed. Fiscal policy should adhere to cyclically-adjusted targets unless
activity falls significantly short of projections, in which case adjustment should be smoothed in countries that can
afford it. In the United States, the imperatives are to agree to and implement a credible medium-term fiscal
adjustment roadmap. In Japan, the plan should be strengthened considerably, notwithstanding the recent approval
of a timetable for consumption tax increase. Central banks should continue managing downside risks to growth
while addressing factors that hinder the effectiveness of monetary transmission.
Appropriate policy responses in emerging economies vary widely reflecting differing conditions. For those
with low public debt or pursuing policies to move further from externally- to domestically-driven growth, placing
consolidation on hold is appropriate in light of the weaker outlook. Others should rebuild fiscal room for maneuver
over time. Where inflation is tame, monetary policy can remain on hold or be eased. However, monetary policy
needs to be more cautious where inflationary pressures remain elevated and should be supported by macroprudential measures where credit growth and real estate prices are high.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Recent developments point to some stabilization of financial markets and global growth,
owing to policy actions of major central banks and EU governments. Despite these
improvements, global recovery remains weak and fragile under the weight of lingering policy
uncertainty, ongoing economic and fiscal adjustment in advanced countries, and the
unwinding of credit booms in emerging economies. Notwithstanding recent improvements,
levels of financial stress remain elevated in the euro area periphery, hindering growth and
balance sheet repair.
1.
Financial markets have improved since September and global growth appears
to be stabilizing. While the first half of 2012 was marked by a global loss of growth
momentum and an intensification of financial and economic stress in the euro area (see
IMF’s October 2012 World Economic Outlook), recent developments point to stabilization,
following further policy actions:


European equities are trading higher. Bond yields in Italy and Spain have come down
significantly, though they remain at relatively high levels. Periphery bank CDS spreads
have also fallen somewhat and there has been some pickup in bank debt issuance,
especially by stronger institutions. There are some early indications that acute capital
outflow pressures from the periphery may have begun to ease, as reflected by the
slight narrowing of TARGET2 imbalances. In the United States, the announcement of
QE3 led to a strong decline in MBS yields, which may help support the housing
recovery, and a fall of short-term interest rate expectations due to the extension of
the forward guidance.

The latest high-frequency indicators suggest that global GDP growth might be
stabilizing, albeit at a sluggish rate. Recent economic indicators have been stronger-

3
than-expected in the United States, as the recovery in the housing sector continued
and consumer spending picked up, while in the euro area activity remains weak.
However, unemployment remains unacceptably high in most advanced economies.
There are signs that a broad recovery is underway in Brazil, as reflected in indicators
of retail sales, industrial production, and confidence; India is benefitting from a
financial markets rally after its announcement of reforms (to FDI and subsidies); and
growth in China appears to be stabilizing. In contrast, growth in Russia has been
decelerating since the second quarter of this year, amid weak external demand.
2.
Recent stabilization comes on the heels of further monetary policy easing and
other supportive actions. Unconventional monetary policy has been at the heart of the
policy response in advanced economies, while emerging markets have also eased
considerably.


The firewall of the euro area has been strengthened with the activation of the
European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The introduction of the ECB’s Outright
Monetary Transactions (OMT) expanded the policy armor in a significant way,
allowing effective intervention in dislocated bond markets. Under the OMT, the ECB
can purchase sovereign bonds in the secondary market without ex ante limit or
seniority but under strict conditionality for countries with EFSF/ESM access. This is
aimed at repairing the monetary policy transmission to the real economy throughout
the euro area and addressing severe distortions in government bond markets
originating from investor fears about EMU viability. EU leaders have also recently
agreed on a single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks, which will open the
possibility for the ESM to recapitalize banks directly, although complex issues still
have to be resolved, including valuation of troubled assets. In the meantime,
periphery countries are pressing ahead with significant fiscal adjustment and
structural reform.



Other major central banks have announced additional quantitative easing to support
activity and demand. The Fed has announced it will start purchasing additional MBS
at a pace of US$40 billion per month. It has also extended its forward guidance,
noting that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the
federal funds rate at least through mid-2015. The Bank of Japan recently further
eased monetary policy through expanding its asset purchase program by about 2
percent of GDP. The Bank of England has expanded its quantitative easing program
and launched an innovative Funding for Lending Scheme to encourage credit flow to
the nonfinancial private sector.



In G-20 emerging economies, many central banks have postponed anticipated
monetary tightening and some—including Brazil, China and South Africa—have cut

4
policy rates. Fiscal tightening was also postponed in several economies. In Russia,
policy rates were raised in September, despite the growing signs of economic
slowdown, to anchor inflation expectations amid rising headline inflation.
3.
Despite the latest improvements, recovery in advanced economies is being held
back by lingering uncertainty about the course of policy, as well as tight financial
conditions, balance sheet repair, and ongoing fiscal consolidation.


Uncertainty about the policy course in major G-20 economies continues weighing on
confidence, financial markets, and baseline growth. While the announcement of OMT
has supported market confidence and

taken on both the short-term and long-term
path of U.S. fiscal policy, and in Japan, budget funding problems should be resolved.



At the same time, still weak private and public balance sheets are weighing on
demand. High household debt reduces creditworthiness and impels saving and
caution with new borrowing, while banks maintain tight lending standards—partly in
response to market and regulatory pressures to reduce leverage and strengthen
capital buffers. As a result, both supply of and demand for credit are squeezed,
depressing consumption and investment.



In addition, growth is weaker because of ongoing fiscal adjustment, which seems to be
having more pronounced effects than anticipated. This likely reflects multiple
prevailing factors: policy rates are at or close to the zero bound in major advanced
economies, limiting the space for monetary policy support to accompany
consolidation; many countries are pursuing consolidation simultaneously, limiting

5
offsets from external demand; and ―crowding in‖ effects on other private spending
may be weaker than otherwise, given uncertainty and balance sheet repair.
4.
Activity in emerging economies is also being held back—by spillovers from
advanced economies and domestic factors. Weak external demand provides a challenging
environment. In some cases, financial channels add to the pressure with international
investors staying away from EM equity markets, though inflows into EM bonds continued
through the year. At the same time, in a number

Box 1: Financial Fragmentation in the Euro Area
Despite some recent easing of capital outflows from the periphery and improved
prospects, financial fragmentation in the euro area remains an issue.
Euro area financial fragmentation intensified in the first half of 2012, as capital flowed
from periphery to core and outside the euro area. Investors reduced their exposure to
periphery countries and hedged against convertibility risk by matching their periphery
assets and liabilities country by country. Capital outflows from Spain and Italy were
sizeable in the past year, though they started abating for Italy in the second quarter of
2012. Private capital outflows took the form of sharp reductions in cross-border bank
lending, portfolio outflows (especially out of sovereign bonds but also corporate bonds in
Spain) and deposit outflows from the periphery. Capital outflows gave rise to large
TARGET2 (i.e., cross-border settlement) imbalances and private funding has been replaced
mainly with periphery banks drawing on the Eurosystem through ECB liquidity operations.
Financial fragmentation was also manifested in a large divergence of funding costs and
CDS spreads for sovereigns, banks, and the non-financial corporate sector.
Following the ECB’s announcement of OMT, there are early indications that capital
outflow pressures in the periphery may have begun to ease—reflected in the latest data
(i.e., narrower cross-border claims via the ECB under TARGET2). Sovereign and bank CDS
spreads have also declined but remain elevated. This suggests financial fragmentation
remains an issue and limits significantly the effectiveness of the common monetary policy
and low policy rates.

6.
Exchange rates have responded following recent central bank actions. Most
notably, the euro has strengthened in real effective terms recently, indicating that ECB action
has so far been successful in reducing market concerns about convertibility risk within the
euro area. Partly reflecting a stronger euro, the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen have
reversed part of their appreciations earlier this year. So far the currencies of emerging

real effective terms.

II. OUTLOOK & RISKS
The outlook is for a modest reacceleration of activity provided that major policy mistakes are
avoided and efforts are made to further build on the commitments aimed at maintaining euro
area integrity. Downside risks remain considerable, however. One risk is that policies are not
implemented decisively enough in the euro area. Other risks stem from abrupt tightening of
U.S. fiscal policy or uncertainty about raising the debt ceiling could hurt markets and growth.
Risks also flow from the absence of sufficiently ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans in the United States and Japan. Finally, potential output growth may have been
overestimated in both advanced and emerging economies, and a reevaluation of future
prospects could dampen current activity.
7.
A modest reacceleration of activity is expected, assuming policies are
sufficiently supportive. Recent developments so far support staff’s projection of a slow
reacceleration of growth. The WEO’s forecast of a pickup in activity is however predicated on
two critical assumptions. The first is that policies are implemented decisively in the euro area
to gradually restore confidence and ease financial conditions. The second assumption is that
U.S. policymakers will effectively avoid the fiscal cliff and raise the debt ceiling. Absent such
actions, the world could slide into another downturn, with deep recession in the euro area
periphery, and contraction or stagnation in the core and other advanced economies.
8.
Global output is projected to modestly
expand by 3.3 percent in 2012 and 3.6 percent
in 2013. Both numbers are weaker than envisaged
in April. G-20 advanced economies would only grow
by 1.6 percent a year in both 2012 and 2013. G-20
emerging economies will remain an engine of
growth, but the rate of expansion is expected to
drop to 5.6 percent this year from 7.1 percent in
2011, before rebounding to 6.2 percent in 2013 in
response to easier macroeconomic policies.
However, growth could be much lower if either of
the two critical policy assumptions is not satisfied.

9.
Inflation is expected to continue moderating. Core inflation has generally been
subdued and steady in advanced economies at rates below target and has declined in
emerging economies. There is concern, however, that swollen central bank balance sheets
would ultimately lead to a significant rise of the money supply and thus inflation. Central
banks though have sufficient tools to absorb the liquidity they create to forestall future
inflation but will need to remain vigilant to such risks as economic slack diminishes. At the

9
current juncture, ample slack in many advanced economies and less pressure on capacity in
emerging economies are likely to lead to further declines in inflation. However, this forecast
is predicated on stable or declining commodity prices as predicted by futures markets. A
reversal of food price increases is by no means guaranteed, partly due to low buffer stocks.
Another important concern is the possibility of a sharp spike in oil prices triggered by
geopolitical tensions (as discussed in the June 2012 Global Risk Analysis report).1
10.
Uncertainty about the outlook and downside risks remains considerable. While
downside risks may have diminished somewhat lately, they still appear much higher than
half a year ago. The probability of global growth falling below 2 percent in 2013—a number
consistent with recession in advanced economies and a serious slowdown in emerging
market and developing economies—stood at about 17 percent in September, up from about
4 percent in April. Considerable threats to sustained recovery loom in different corners of the
world.
11.
Financial conditions in the euro area remain fragile and implementation risks
are present. While ECB action has taken some major tail risks off the table, political
economy factors may prevent countries from requesting ESM programs and accessing the
OMT in a timely fashion. Another risk is that austerity may become politically and socially
untenable in periphery countries, as structural and fiscal reforms will still take years to
complete. Moreover, the critical elements of establishing a banking union with common
fiscal backstops will take some time to implement. A re-intensification of stresses would
result in rising spreads and contracting credit, and governments under pressure would be
forced to implement even further fiscal adjustment, resulting in larger GDP losses and
significant spillovers on other economies.

12.
U.S. fiscal policy is another major source of risk that is fast approaching. In
particular:


Current law implies automatic tax increases
and spending cuts amounting to $700 billion
in 2013—a tightening of around 4 ½ percent
of GDP. If realized, this would push the
country into a recession with large
international spillovers. The severity of the
economic effects would partly depend on the
duration of the cliff. Even if the ―fiscal cliff‖
were quickly unwound, the damage to the
economy could be substantial, especially if
consumers and businesses were faced with
continued uncertainty about tax and
spending policies.



Moreover, the absence of a deal on raising
the debt ceiling also conjures up the specter of a dramatic tightening or even
technical default. Failing to do this in a timely fashion adds to risk of financial market
volatility. While investors are treating such events as tail risks—as U.S. policymakers
have in the past always been able to pull back from the brink—the shocks, if realized,
will be very large.



At the same time, U.S. debt dynamics are not sustainable over the long run. Failing to
agree soon on a credible plan to put the federal debt on a sustainable path could
exacerbate uncertainty and thereby detract from activity; over the medium to longterm, it could lead to a gradual erosion of the reserve currency status of the U.S.
dollar and put upward pressure on Treasury bond yields.

13.
Japan’s fiscal situation is also unsustainable, despite the approval of the phased
increase in the consumption tax rate. There are indications of investor concern about
heightened exchange rate risk and interest rate volatility at longer horizons (even if current
yields are at multi-year lows), given large holdings of public debt by the financial sector.
Therefore, there is a risk of large and disorderly correction in market pricing of these risks.
14.
Potential growth may be lower in both advanced and emerging economies.
Recent growth disappointments may be symptomatic of deeper problems.


In advanced economies, the impact of the financial crisis and prolonged economic
slump on investment, labor supply, human capital and technological progress—and
hence on potential output—may be larger than already assumed. The high share of

11
long-term unemployed is losing valuable skills and attachment to the labor market.
With growth in advanced economies expected to remain sluggish for some time and
with risks of setbacks, this creates a very challenging environment for emerging and
developing economies. Emerging Europe looks particularly vulnerable to spillovers
from advanced economies given their limited policy space.


In emerging economies, strong growth over the last few years may have been aided
by favorable terms of trade, easy funding conditions, and difficult-to-sustain credit
expansion, with actual growth getting ahead of underlying potential. Hence, with
credit booms unwinding, domestic demand could be slowing fast and could be
amplified by a reevaluation of medium-term growth prospects and risks, both via
income expectations and because of heightened concerns about banks and the
sustainability of adjustment efforts. Importantly, a slowdown in major emerging
economies would have a noticeable impact on their trading partners as well as on
commodity exporters.

15.
Growth could also be stronger—if policymakers act quickly to further
strengthen policies. In the euro area, presenting a credible roadmap toward a banking
union with greater fiscal integration followed promptly by implementation—such as putting
in place a bank resolution mechanism with common backstops, or concrete measures
toward fiscal integration—would help reverse capital outflows from the periphery. In this
scenario, funding costs could normalize, credit channels would reopen, and economic
growth would return to the periphery and pick up in the core. Most other parts of the world
would also see a noticeable output increase relative to the baseline. In the United States,
early agreement on raising the debt ceiling and dealing with the ―fiscal cliff‖—in a manner
that does not postpone the problem—could help strengthen baseline policies. In the United
States and Japan, durably addressing their fiscal challenges quickly would help lift global
uncertainty and boost global growth prospects, while solidifying their position as safe
havens.

12

III. POLICY IMPERATIVES
The main challenge for policymakers is to act forcefully to address downside risks with strong
policy implementation; durable medium-term fiscal adjustment; and targeted structural
reform. In the euro area—building on OMT and ESM activation, further action is also needed to
strengthen banks, address structural shortcomings and complete EMU. Circumstances vary
across emerging markets, but many should act to restore fiscal buffers over time, use monetary
policy to guard against downside risks, and rely on macro-prudential measures to safeguard
financial stability. Continued demand rebalancing from deficit to surplus economies would
strengthen global growth and, if done properly, would help resolve their internal imbalances.
16.
In the euro area, robust action and follow-through are required on multiple
fronts. Sovereigns under stress need to continue to adjust and request appropriate
EFSF/ESM support if needed; and support for them and their banks provided via the ESM
would relieve funding pressures and break the adverse feedback loops between sovereigns
and banks. Meanwhile, the ECB’s commitment to act on secondary markets via the OMT is
critical to address elevated risk premia due to convertibility concerns within the euro area,
while maintaining a very accommodative monetary policy should support demand. Anticrisis measures need to be anchored by a vision of—as well as a reasonably fast and tangible
progress toward—a more complete monetary union, supported by a banking union and
greater fiscal integration.


Access to funding at reasonable costs is essential to allow economies to adjust
successfully. While economies in the periphery must continue to adjust their fiscal
balances at a pace they can bear, in the current fragile environment, putting in place
the right policies may not be sufficient to fully restore the confidence of markets, not
least because of implementation risks. Lower interest rates and easier financial
conditions are key factors to facilitate balance sheet repair and support growth in the
periphery. Common resources can be channeled via the ESM, and additional support
should be provided through the OMT for eligible euro area members.



Further repairing banks’ balance sheets while avoiding a pro-cyclical financial
tightening are also crucial in the near term. While viable banks should be recapitalized,
non-viable ones should be resolved, in a least-cost manner. Where recapitalization of
banks threatens public debt sustainability and/or financial stability, direct equity
injections into banks are instrumental for cutting adverse bank-sovereign loops and
could be done through the ESM. Clarity on the specific terms of ESM bank
recapitalization options is needed soon. For this to happen, common bank
supervision—a precondition for ESM taking stakes in banks—should be established
without delay. While the recapitalization exercise launched by the EBA in October
2011 has helped strengthen the capital position of many European banks, they should

13
aim at further rebuilding of capital levels to restore market confidence, especially in
periphery countries, where the sharp deteriorations of the outlook could further test
the adequacy of capital buffers. For this, external support may be instrumental to
avoid an even deeper credit crunch.


An integrated regulatory and supervisory structure—a banking union—is indispensable
for smooth functioning of integrated financial markets in EMU. Such a union should
rest on a single supervisory-regulatory framework; a pan euro area resolution
mechanism with common backstops; and a pan euro area deposit guarantee scheme.
Some building blocks are already shaping up, but there can be no let up in the
momentum to put in place the complete structure and reaching agreement on
contentious but critical components. Also, agreement would be needed on
governance arrangements and voice for non euro area EU members who may wish to
opt into a banking union (given close financial ties and the potential benefits) but who
do not necessarily adopt the euro.



Fiscal integration would provide critical tools to backstop a banking union; help prevent
idiosyncratic shocks from becoming systemic; and constrain imprudent policies. The
immediate priority is to establish a common fiscal backstop and resolution framework
for a banking union anchored by a single supervisory mechanism. Beyond that, larger
fiscal buffers at the national level would go some way toward smoothing the impact
of adverse country-specific shocks. But given their magnitude, and recognizing the
greater political complexity of fiscal union, some form of risk sharing at the euro area
level might also be warranted within the union. Greater fiscal integration would also
help manage perceived default risks that have arisen from sovereign-bank stresses in
economies under market pressure and their spillovers to other members. Crucially,
mutual support needs to be complemented by stricter and more robustly enforced
rules and greater coordination of national policies—including through swift approval
and implementation of the Fiscal Compact (at the country level).

17.
Fiscal consolidation should be gradual and sustained. Considerable adjustment
has already occurred, but many advanced economies still have a long way to go. On
average, in advanced economies, the ratio of cyclically-adjusted general government
balances to potential GDP is projected to improve by about ¾ percent of potential GDP in
2012 and 1 percent in 2013. In emerging economies as a group, no substantial consolidation
is envisaged for this year or next.


It is essential to calibrate the pace of adjustment with both the state of the economy
and funding pressures in mind. The amount of planned fiscal consolidation in
advanced economies appears relatively sizable over the near term—consistent with
high debt and the slight increase in economic growth projected in the WEO—
although with significant differences across countries. Where financial conditions

permit, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate, and fiscal targets should
be specified in cyclically-adjusted or structural terms. In case of large negative shocks
or growth disappointments, the pace of consolidation should be smoothed in
countries that can afford it.


U.S. authorities should act early to avoid the fiscal cliff and raise the debt ceiling. While
markets view a major disruption associated with these issues as a tail risk, the
uncertainty about when and how they will be resolved may be weighing on demand.
Importantly, a last minute deal that relies on suboptimal fixes or largely ―kicks the can
down the road‖ may ultimately prove harmful. Moreover, if contrary to the
expectations a resolution is not found, confidence in U.S. policymakers will erode—
which could have large domestic and international ramifications.



Fiscal adjustment must be anchored by concrete and ambitious medium-term
consolidation plans. At the moment, the U.S. lacks agreement on such a plan, and
Japan’s plan needs to be strengthened further despite the recent welcome approval
of a timetable for doubling the consumption tax rate. Adjustments would be required
on both expenditure and revenue sides of the ledger. It is important to move early to
reduce the growth of aging-related expenditures—and while some measures have
been enacted in Europe to reduce retirement costs, more can be done in all
advanced economies, particularly to lower health-related spending. More robust
fiscal frameworks would support the credibility of adjustment plans.



Emerging markets are generally in better fiscal position but some still need to rebuild
room for maneuver. On average, G-20 emerging economies have much lower public
debt than advanced economies. However, historically, market tolerance though
toward EM debt has also been lower, and fiscal buffers could thus be usefully
restored over time. In particular, medium-term fiscal targets should be more
ambitious in Russia (to reduce the non-oil deficit and improve intergenerational
equity) and Turkey (to support external adjustment and reduce pressure on the
central bank). India needs to adopt substantial fiscal reforms to anchor medium-term
fiscal consolidation. While fiscal consolidation has stalled this year, a high level
commission has presented a new medium-term road map. Recent steps to reduce
fuel subsidies are also welcome. By contrast, economies that have sufficient fiscal
space (e.g., China) can use discretionary fiscal stimulus with a view of promoting, or
at least not hindering, the needed rebalancing of the economy towards consumption,
should downside risks materialize.

18.
Monetary policy should continue to aid recovery. Central banks have been at the
forefront of the policy response to the recent global slowdown, and should continue
supporting the recovery, while managing risks to price stability (Box 2).

15


In advanced economies, monetary policy should remain very accommodative and
central banks should stand ready to do more if needed.



In Japan, further monetary easing may also be needed to reach the 1 percent inflation
goal. The effectiveness of the easing in Japan would be enhanced by broadening
asset purchases to include more equities and corporate bonds and government
bonds with longer maturities and by simultaneously adopting broad structural and
fiscal reforms to achieve a sustained recovery. In the U.S., improving the transmission
of the monetary easing would require resolution of the household debt overhang. In
the euro area, restoring the transmission channel requires addressing counterparty
risk in the interbank market and the redenomination risk. Central banks should also
carefully monitor unintended consequences their policies might have, for instance on
sovereign-bank linkages, corporate leverage, and financial innovation as well as
external spillovers.



Policy requirements differ vastly among emerging economies, but many can afford to
stay on hold or ease if downside risks materialize given the receding inflation pressures.
Nevertheless, some countries in Asia and Latin America face late-cycle credit risks as
nonperforming loans have started to turn up, which constrains space for financial
policies. Some countries (e.g., Argentina and India) should remain watchful of
inflationary pressures and cannot afford to lower interest rates further. In Brazil,
policymakers should stand ready to start unwinding monetary stimulus as the
recovery proceeds in order to securely anchor inflation expectations. Room for
monetary easing may also be limited where a strong credit expansion continues or
where currencies are undervalued. If needed to support demand, fiscal policy—
provided space is available—may be the appropriate tool in such cases.

16

Box 2: Unconventional Monetary Policies—How Might They Work?
Major central banks have announced new unconventional policy measures recently: the ECB’s Outright
Monetary Transactions (OMT), the Fed’s QE3, the BOE's extension of its QE and new Funding for Lending
Scheme (FLS), and the BOJ’s expansion of its asset purchase program. While broadly grouped under
―unconventional monetary policy‖, they vary in design and rationale. For instance, in the United States, QE1
was undertaken to intervene directly in specific dislocated segments of the credit markets (i.e., ―credit
easing‖), but the purpose of QE2, Operation Twist (OT), and recent QE3 was mainly to lower long-term
yields. Several ECB measures—SMP, LTROs, and the recent OMT—have aimed to remove multiple equilibria
and reduce rollover or convertibility risks within the euro area as part of broader crisis management
measures. The main goal of the BOJ’s monetary easing policies is to defeat deflation, and the BOE intends to
ease bank credit conditions by intervening through its new FLS.
Quantitative easing has aimed at stimulating demand and preventing a sharper deterioration in
financial conditions since the onset of the crisis. Measures operate through various channels. By lowering
the ―risk-free‖ rate, they may lead to asset reallocation toward risky assets and lower equilibrium risk
premium (portfolio rebalancing effect). The corresponding rise in asset values can stimulate consumption
through wealth effects and investment through a lower cost of capital (liquidity effect). They may also have
signaling effect by anchoring market expectations that monetary stimulus will not be withdrawn until a
durable recovery is in sight. Another channel is the exchange rate, though its strength is reduced when
other central banks act at the same time. While there is a wide range of estimates, various studies have
found that previous Fed’s policies—QE1, QE2, and OT—reduced the 10-year Treasury yields meaningfully.
Forward guidance on the path of the policy rate over a longer period also helped to lower rates across the
yield curve. Although growth effects are difficult to ascertain, the impact on yields in the case of QE1 is
estimated to have boosted growth by ¼ to ½ percentage points over two years. Similarly, the BOE’s QE1 in
2009 lowered sovereign yields significantly, boosting GDP by an estimated 1½ to 2 percent. The BOE’s QE2
in 2011–12 brought more muted market reactions, partly due to market anticipation ahead of the actual
announcement. Staff studies find that BOJ’s monetary easing through its new asset purchase program
(currently totaling 17 percent of GDP), has been effective in supporting activity and inflation, lowering bond
yields, and raising equity prices.
While policy benefits are often the focus, unintended consequences should be monitored closely.
Very low interest rates can adversely affect short-term money market functioning and delay needed balance
sheet restructuring of financial institutions. Beyond possible untoward domestic effects including excessive
risk taking and leverage, very accommodative monetary policies of advanced economies (AEs) have raised
concerns in emerging economies (EMs) about surges in capital inflows and upward pressures on exchange
rates, especially in those with more open capital accounts. Staff analysis suggests that unconventional
easing in AEs can impart temporary appreciation pressures in some EMs1; however, stronger demand in AEs
can benefit them through higher exports and broader confidence effects. Studies also emphasize as much a
role of pull factors (e.g., better growth outlook in EMs) as that of push factors (low interest rates in AEs) in
international spillovers. However, one has to acknowledge that there may be risks of global credit
mispricing, reflected by excessive tightening in EM credit spreads for some, due to the combination of low
yields in AEs and rigidity of exchange rate policies in some EMs.

19.
Prudential authorities must control credit risks. In advanced economies, prudential
authorities must continue to push balance sheet repair and, where necessary, impose losses
on bank stakeholders and force recapitalization, which may require using public funds. In
emerging economies, supervisory and macro-prudential measures should be employed to
counter possible credit bubbles, such as for real estate; countries exposed to volatile capital
flows should strengthen their macroprudential frameworks. Such measures could also be
used to smooth volatile capital flows.
20.
For emerging economies, rising food prices present particular challenges, given
their high weight in consumption, notably for poorer households. Central banks should
not react to first-round effects of food price increases but should communicate clearly their
intent to tighten if second-round pressures start building to prevent spillovers into core
inflation, wages and expectations more generally. Vulnerable groups should be protected
through targeted transfers rather than broad subsidies to contain fiscal costs, while meeting
social objectives. Countries that face incipient trade pressures should access multilateral
finance to support balance of payments needs. Food-exporting countries should avoid
protective trade policies such as export bans and export taxes and quotas, which would
further drive up food prices and volatility. International coordination of responses—
including via G-20 initiatives—would help address the issue, if food prices continue to rise.
21.
The financial regulatory reform agenda has been advanced, but implementation
is still in early stages and the global financial system is not appreciably safer than
before the crisis. Risks related to delayed or inconsistent implementation across economies
could create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, gaps, or conflicts in regulation—which
could undermine financial stability and ultimately harm members’ growth objectives. It is
crucial to strike a proper balance between the necessary strengthening of the resilience of
the financial system and the need to cushion the impact of the adjustment on economic
activity. Key areas of attention for further progress include cross-border resolution and
supervision, the too-important-to-fail issue, consistent implementation of the reforms in the
over-the-counter derivatives market, and closing critical information gaps.
22.
Global imbalances have narrowed considerably, but largely on the back of
slumping demand. Much of the adjustment in current accounts came from demand
compression in crisis-stricken deficit economies. More constructive influences—from the
point of view of supporting global growth—include more robust domestic demand in China
(although stronger consumption would have been preferable to a boost to already very high
investment) and more social spending by oil exporters, as well as depreciation in several EM
deficit currencies. Imbalances have narrowed within the euro area as well, with the main
driver being lower demand in the periphery. However, there has also been progress with
relative unit labor cost (ULC) adjustment, as ULC declined in crisis economies (though in part

18
through apparent productivity gains arising from labor shedding) and increased in some
surplus countries.

Policies that support growth and reduce domestic vulnerabilities would lead to
a further reduction in imbalances. As deficit economies continue necessary fiscal
consolidation, global growth should be supported by stronger demand from surplus
economies. That demand can be promoted by boosting investment in advanced surplus
economies (where it has been lagging), broadening social safety nets in certain emerging
economies, and, where appropriate, cutting back on reserve accumulation and allowing
more exchange rate flexibility. Over time, structural reforms would help improve
competitiveness in deficit economies—including the euro area periphery—and increase the
reliance of growth on domestic sources in surplus ones. Importantly, these adjustments
would be in the individual interests of countries concerned (surplus and deficit economies
alike) and effectively lower global imbalances and related vulnerabilities.
