EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery has weakened further amid increasing financial turbulence and falling asset prices.
Activity softened towards the end of 2015 and the valuation of risky assets has dropped sharply, especially in
advanced economies, increasing the likelihood of a further weakening of the outlook. Growth in advanced
economies is modest already under the baseline, as low demand in some countries and a broad-based
weakening of potential growth continue to hold back the recovery. Adding to these headwinds are concerns
about the global impact of China’s transition to more balanced growth, along with signs of distress in other
large emerging markets, including from falling commodity prices. Heightened risk aversion has triggered
global equity market declines and brought a further tightening of external financial conditions for emerging
economies. Strong policy responses both at national and multilateral levels are needed to contain risks and
propel the global economy to a more prosperous path.
These developments point to higher risks of a derailed recovery, at a moment when the global economy
is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks. Financial market turbulence and asset price declines have tightened
financial conditions in advanced economies and, if persistent, could further weaken growth. Emerging market
stress could rise more, also reflecting domestic vulnerabilities. At the same time, there is a risk that the decline
in oil prices will further destabilize the outlook of oil exporters while the impact on importers generates less
demand support than expected, lowering global growth and exacerbating the current low-inflation
environment. Finally, shocks of a non-economic origin―related to geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, refugees,
and global epidemics―loom over some countries and regions, and, if left unchecked, could have significant
spillover impacts on global economic activity.
The fragile conjuncture increases the urgency of a broad-based policy response that strengthens growth
and manages vulnerabilities.



Strengthening growth. In advanced economies, securing higher and sustainable growth requires a mix of
mutually-reinforcing demand and supply policies. On the demand side, accommodative monetary policy
remains essential where inflation is still well below central banks’ targets. However, a comprehensive
approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy. In particular, near-term fiscal policy
should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through
investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy. In a number of
countries, efforts to accelerate the repair of private sector balance sheets would help improve the
transmission of monetary policy and support domestic demand. On the supply side, across advanced and
emerging economies, credible and well-designed structural reforms remain critical to lift potential output,
and can provide some near-term demand support directly and through increased confidence and
expectations of higher future income.



Securing resilience. In emerging economies, policymakers should reduce macroeconomic and financial
vulnerabilities and rebuild resilience. In commodity exporters, fiscal buffers can help smooth the
adjustment to lower commodity prices, but it will be important to plan for fiscal adjustment and new, more
diverse growth models. Exchange rate flexibility, where feasible, should also be used to cushion the impact
of adverse external shocks, with a temporary role for foreign exchange interventions to prevent disorderly
market conditions. Rebuilding resilience also requires strengthening supervision and macro-prudential
frameworks, as well as addressing corporate and banking sector vulnerabilities.

At the same time, bold multilateral actions are needed to boost growth and contain risks.



Coordinating the international policy response. To support global activity and contain risks, the G20 must
act now to implement forcefully the existing G-20 growth strategies and plan for coordinated demand
support using available fiscal space to boost public investment and complement structural reforms.



Enhancing the global financial safety net and oversight. To address the potentially protracted risks faced by
commodity exporters and emerging markets with strong fundamentals but high vulnerability, there may
be a need to consider reforms to the global financial safety net, including new financing mechanisms.



Ring-fencing spillovers from non-economic shocks. Countries at the center of the current refugee crises and
epidemics are shouldering a burden for others and could be backed up by a coordinated global initiative
―with those at risk from spillovers contributing financial support, and multilateral agencies, including the
Fund, reassessing how they can best help channel those resources to areas of most need.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
The recovery has weakened further amid increasing financial market turbulence and falling asset
prices. These developments, if they persist, could add to the existing headwinds for the global outlook,
including the already modest recovery in advanced economies, China’s rebalancing, the weaker-thanexpected growth impact from lower oil prices, and generally diminished growth prospects in emerging
and low-income economies. This points to higher risks of a derailed recovery, at a moment when the
global economy is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks.
1.
Global activity has slowed unexpectedly at the end of 2015, and it has weakened
further in early 2016 amid falling asset prices. Activity in 2015Q4 seems to have softened in the
United States, the euro area, and Japan. In emerging economies, China’s GDP slowed in line with
forecasts, while trade data suggest weak economic activity in the rest of emerging Asia. Lower oil
prices and domestic strife in several economies have weakened prospects for the Middle East, and
Brazil’s recession has turned out deeper and more protracted than previously expected. In January,
the IMF’s forecasts for global growth have been revised downward by 0.2 percentage points for
both 2016 and 2017, to 3.4 and 3.6 percent respectively, and a downgrade is likely as the outlook is
revised for the April World Economic Outlook (WEO).
2.
The baseline outlook suggests a continuation of the
modest recovery in advanced economies, and weaker
growth prospects in emerging economies.

In advanced economies, the recovery will continue to be
modest, reflecting a combination of weak demand and slow
potential growth in the aftermath of the crisis. In the United
States, domestic demand is expected to remain robust,
supported by still easy financial conditions and
strengthening housing and labor markets. However, the
economy is facing headwinds owing to dollar appreciation
and cuts in structures and equipment investment in the
mining sector—notably in energy—prompting increasing
market expectations for a slower monetary policy
normalization by the Fed. The euro area continues to
recover gradually, in part supported by lower oil prices,
despite slowing net exports. However, low investment, high
unemployment, and weak balance sheets weigh on growth.
Growth in Japan remains weak but should firm somewhat in
2016, on the back of fiscal stimulus, lower oil prices,
accommodative financial conditions, and rising incomes.
In emerging economies, growth prospects remain weak in
historical perspective, reflecting a variety of factors,

slow.
3.
China’s transition has been among the key factors behind the weakening of global
manufacturing, trade, and investment. The deceleration in Chinese manufacturing activity,
especially in some overcapacity sectors, has brought a significant slowdown in imports and
impacted commodity prices and confidence. Other important factors at play include the further
deterioration in vulnerable countries, the continued need for corporate deleveraging in advanced
economies, in particular the euro area, and lower global investment and trade, likely reflecting in
part downward revisions in private agents’ expectations about long-term growth prospects.
4.
Oil prices have further declined markedly, reflecting subdued global demand and
expectations of sustained increases in production by OPEC members. Lower oil prices strain the
fiscal positions of fuel exporters and weigh on their growth prospects, while supporting household
demand and lowering business energy costs in importers. Part of the decline in oil prices has been
driven by higher oil supply. This should support global demand given a higher propensity to spend
in oil importers relative to oil exporters. However, several factors have dampened the positive
impact of lower oil prices. First and foremost, financial strains in many oil exporters reduce their
ability to smooth the shock, entailing a sizable reduction in their domestic demand. The oil price
decline also has had a notable impact on investment in oil and gas extraction, also subtracting from
global aggregate demand. Finally, the pickup in consumption in oil importers has so far been
somewhat weaker than expected, possibly reflecting continued deleveraging in some of these
economies and a limited pass-through of price declines to consumers in several emerging market
and developing economies.
5.
With renewed declines in commodity prices and weakness in global manufacturing,
headline inflation is set to soften again in most countries. Core inflation rates remain generally
stable and well below inflation objectives in advanced economies. Inflation developments are more
mixed in emerging market economies, arising from conflicting effects of currency depreciations and
lower commodity prices, alongside weak domestic demand.

6.
Financial market volatility has risen amid declining asset prices. This adjustment is
difficult to explain by weaker fundamentals alone, and may also be reflecting a correction of rich
asset price valuations, some market overreaction, or a more fundamental re-assessment of the
outlook and concerns about lack of policy actions. Global risk aversion has increased, in part
reflecting persistent modest growth in advanced economies and questions about the speed at which
China’s economy is slowing and the authorities’ policy responses. One result has been substantial
declines in global equity markets, the widening of credit spreads, and historically low yields for safe
haven government bonds. The rise in global risk aversion has led to a further tightening of external
financial conditions for emerging economies in the face of their diminished growth prospects.
Moreover, capital flows—particularly portfolio flows—have declined, many sovereign spreads have
increased, and many currencies have depreciated further against the U.S. dollar. Financial conditions
in advanced economies, while remaining accommodative overall, have seen some tightening
associated with increasing yields in corporate debt markets and lower equity prices. At the same
time, banks experienced sharp declines in share prices, on the back of weakening profitability,
particularly in Japan and Europe, reflecting the debt overhang legacy, commodity and emerging
economies’ exposures, and negative rates.

Reflecting the weakness of the recovery and turbulence in financial markets, the
global economy is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks. The main risks include:


Persistent financial market turbulence and the associated asset price declines could perpetuate
tighter financial conditions in advanced economies, increasing the cost of capital as well as risk
premiums and interest rates. Wealth effects from asset prices declines could also weigh on
consumption. Such a scenario could have a negative impact on advanced economies and,
ultimately, global growth, adding to existing risks, including from further weakening of
investment in the U.S. energy sector and still high non-performing loans in Europe;



Triggered by developments in financial markets in advanced economies, a more significant and
lasting rise in global risk aversion accompanied by a stronger pullback of capital flows to
emerging markets may generate even tighter financial conditions in these economies. The result
would be further depreciations of emerging market currencies and the possibility of significant
adverse corporate balance sheet effects and funding challenges. Vulnerabilities—including those
associated with further declines in commodity prices—and further negative news about

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

emerging economies’ growth prospects could worsen the initial impact of the surge in risk
aversion;


A sharper-than-currently-expected slowdown in China, with stronger spillovers through trade,
commodity prices, confidence, financial market volatility, and currency valuations (see Annex 1).
This outcome could lead to a more generalized slowdown in both emerging and advanced
economies, especially if it further affected investment, potential growth, and expectations of
future income;



With vanishing fiscal buffers, further declines in oil prices could mean that oil exporters would
have to cut spending significantly. The absence of buffers might have further detrimental effects
on global activity relative to the baseline, especially if the decline in oil prices fails to deliver the
expected boost to demand in oil-importing countries. In the current low inflation environment,
this comes with a risk of a further reduction in inflation expectations;



Finally, a worsening of geopolitical tensions and other shocks from a non-economic origin—
such as terrorism, refugees, and global epidemics―loom over some countries and regions, and
could have large spillover impacts on global activity, disrupting global trade, financial, and
tourism flows.

POLICIES TO BOOST GROWTH AND CONTAIN RISKS
The fragile conjuncture requires a comprehensive policy response both at the national and the G-20
level. In many advanced economies, where the recovery remains disappointingly weak, both demand
and supply measures are needed to deliver stronger growth gains. Emerging economies, faced with
tightening external financial conditions and diminished growth prospects, should focus on managing
vulnerabilities and rebuilding resilience while implementing policies to lift potential growth. At the
G-20 level, the full and prompt implementation of G-20 growth strategies will support global activity.
However, should global downside risks materialize, more action will be needed, and the G-20 should
proactively identify policies that could be rolled out quickly if necessary.

WEAKNESSES
8.
Sustainably higher growth will come from a mix of mutually reinforcing demand
support and structural reforms that raise actual along with potential output. For example, a
protracted period of weak demand can lead to lower potential output, through both hysteresis
effects and persistently low investment. In turn, lower potential growth depresses expected future
income, which reduces demand today. On the policy side, some structural reforms can lift supply
while also providing a degree of short-run demand support, but others require supportive
macroeconomic policies to speed their positive impacts while minimizing possible short-run
deflationary side-effects (see below and Annex 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation rates are still well
below target. In the United States, following the increase of the federal funds rate in mid-December,
further actions should be well-communicated and based on clear evidence of wage or price
pressures and an assessment that inflation is set to rise steadily toward the Federal Reserve’s two
percent medium-term objective. In the euro area, the ECB’s asset purchase program has supported
the recovery by improving confidence and financial conditions. But with inflation remaining low, the
ECB should continue to signal strongly its willingness to use all the instruments available until its
price stability mandate is met. Moreover, QE should be supported by a more balanced policy mix
comprising fiscal support, balance sheet repair, and structural reforms. In Japan, the introduction of
negative deposit rates by the BoJ underscores its commitment to maintain inflation momentum. To
benefit most from the additional easing, it should be supported with fiscal, structural, and ambitious
incomes policies. Building on recent achievements, the authorities should aim for sustained wage
inflation, supported by higher public sector and minimum wages, alongside labor market reforms
that reduce duality.
10.
To avoid over-reliance on monetary policy, near-term fiscal policy should support the
recovery where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, focusing on investment. Where
public debt is high, commitments to credible medium-term consolidation plans can create policy
space. Where necessary, fiscal consolidation should remain growth-friendly and support policies that
foster innovation and productivity, while protecting the most vulnerable. In the United States, while
the recent bipartisan fiscal agreements was an important positive step, further fiscal efforts are
needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium term as interest rates gradually increase
and the demographic transition intensifies. An early agreement on credible medium-term deficit
reduction would provide the space to fund investments in infrastructure, to raise productivity and
innovation, and enhance workers’ skills. In the euro area, countries with fiscal space should do more
to support growth—for example, through infrastructure investment in Germany. Swift
implementation—and an expansion—of the EU scheme to provide public and private investment
would raise growth in the short and medium term and have positive spillovers in the region.
Temporary costs related to refugee expenditures should generally be accommodated, and the
compatibility with current fiscal targets assessed on a case-by-case basis. In Japan, a commitment to
fiscal consolidation centered on a pre-announced path of gradual consumption tax hikes and a
strengthening of fiscal institutions would create near-term policy space to maintain growth
momentum.
11.
Efforts to raise potential output through structural reforms are critical. Credible
structural reform programs, well-tailored to country needs and designed to raise long-term growth,
can help build confidence and stimulate investment and consumption by raising expected future
incomes. Some structural reforms, such as lowering barriers to entry in product markets, especially
in services, or Active Labor Market Policies, also raise demand directly. Reduction of market rigidities
not only raises potential output, it also improves the effectiveness of demand-side policies.


In the United States, boosting labor supply, productivity, and growth will require simultaneous
policy initiatives on a number of fronts, including an expansion of the earned income tax credit,

an increase in the federal minimum wage, increased family benefits, a comprehensive, skillsbased immigration reform, as well as enhanced infrastructure spending, innovation incentives,
and vocational training.


In the euro area, national-level reforms in labor, product, and services markets, as well as in
insolvency regimes, would help to improve productivity, competitiveness, and private-sector
investment prospects. At the regional level, a strong push toward single markets in capital,
transport, energy, and digital technologies would promote productivity-enhancing economic
integration. A more effective governance framework—including outcome-based structural
reform benchmarks, effective use of EU legislation and full use of SGP flexibility for structural
reforms—is also needed.



In Japan, incomes policies and structural reforms that raise productivity are vital to tackle
medium-term risks coming from continuing lackluster growth and the overburdening of
monetary policy. Structural reforms should focus on boosting labor supply, including by women
and foreigners, reforming labor markets to remove duality, and deregulating further product
and services markets.

12.
In Europe, policy actions to support the integration of migrants into the labor force
are urgently needed. In the short term, the macroeconomic impact of the refugee surge is likely to
be a modest increase in GDP growth, reflecting the fiscal expansion flowing from support of the
asylum seekers. The impact of the refugees on medium to long-term growth and the public finances
depends on how effectively they can be

EMERGING ECONOMIES: REDUCING VULNERABILITIES AND INCREASING POTENTIAL
OUTPUT
13.
In emerging economies, managing vulnerabilities and rebuilding resilience are high
priorities in a context of tightening external financial conditions. An effective response requires
strengthening supervision and macro-prudential frameworks, as well as addressing corporate and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

banking sector vulnerabilities. Those commodity exporters that still have fiscal buffers should use
them to smooth the adjustment to lower commodity prices. Many countries, however, will need to
plan for fiscal adjustment, including through reduced but more efficient public expenditures and
stronger fiscal frameworks, mobilizing new sources of revenues, as well as new growth models.
Exchange rate flexibility can usefully cushion the impact of adverse external shocks, provided that
the effects of currency depreciations on balance sheets and domestic inflation rates are contained.
While net commodity importers benefit from reduced inflation pressures and external vulnerabilities,
the scope for monetary policy easing could be limited in a context tighter external financing
conditions. More specifically:


In China, the challenge is to achieve a transition to a more balanced growth model while
reducing vulnerabilities from excess leverage and strengthening the role of market forces,
including in the foreign exchange market. The authorities should ensure clear communication of
their exchange rate policies and be willing to accept the moderately lower growth consistent
with rebalancing. In other words, the quality of growth matters, not just the quantity. If growth
risks slipping significantly below a prudent range, the first line of defense should be on-budget
fiscal stimulus that supports the rebalancing process. Although the transition process is likely to
entail foreign significant spillovers through trade and commodities, possibly amplified by
financial channels, a well-managed rebalancing of China’s growth model would benefit global
growth down the road and reduce tail risks. The international community should support China’s
efforts to reform and rebalance its economy.



In India, while external vulnerabilities have moderated and inflation has fallen faster than
expected, persistently high inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key
macroeconomic challenges. The monetary policy stance needs to remain tight to ensure a
durable reduction in inflation and inflation expectations. Fiscal consolidation should continue,
underpinned by comprehensive tax reform and further reductions in subsidies. Vulnerabilities in
corporate financial positions and public bank asset quality could threaten financial stability if left
unaddressed.



In Brazil, an appropriate macroeconomic policy mix and restored policy frameworks are
imperative for a turnaround in confidence and investment once major political uncertainties are
resolved. The government should pursue fiscal consolidation by addressing rigidities and
unsustainable mandates on the spending side, including in the social security system, and
through tax measures and discretionary spending cuts to bolster fiscal results in the short run.
The reduction in inflation toward the 4.5 percent target by 2017 will require a tight monetary
policy stance.



In Russia, given the magnitude of the negative shock to revenues from lower oil prices, some
spending adjustment is necessary in 2016, and fiscal consolidation should continue over the
subsequent medium term. Reestablishing the three-year fiscal framework around a revised oil
price rule would help reduce policy uncertainty and support the adjustment. The recent pause in
monetary policy easing has been appropriate given the risks to inflation from ruble depreciation,

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

external risks, and the need to build credibility under the newly introduced inflation targeting
regime.
14.
Policymakers need to press on with structural reforms to lift growth and ensure
continued convergence. Reforms should focus on alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks, facilitating
a dynamic and innovation-friendly business environment, and bolstering human capital. In China,
good progress has been made on financial liberalization and laying the foundations for stronger
local government finances, but the reform strategy for state-owned enterprises needs to be more
ambitious and its implementation accelerated. While this reform aims at modernizing corporate
governance, it continues to emphasize the strategic role of the state while providing no clear road
map to a substantially greater role for the private sector and to imposing hard budget constraints. In
India, authorities should build on recent progress to further relax long-standing supply bottlenecks,
especially in the energy, mining, and power sectors, as well as in the food storage and distribution
sectors. Implementing labor market reforms also remains a priority. In Brazil, structural reforms to
raise productivity and competitiveness, and implementation of the infrastructure concessions
program, are key. In Russia, structural reform should focus on enhancing governance and propertyright protection, lowering administrative barriers and regulation, increasing competition in domestic
markets, and reinvigorating the privatization agenda as soon as market conditions permit.

MULTILATERAL ACTIONS TO BOOST GROWTH AND RESILIENCE
15.
Strong action is needed to achieve full implementation of the G-20 growth strategies
across countries now, which would provide a significant boost to the global economy at a
critical moment. The most recent assessment prepared by the IMF and the OECD for the Antalya
Summit suggested that just under half of key commitment measures have been fully implemented,
with several large countries showing below-average implementation. The implemented measures
are estimated to raise potential G-20 GDP by around 0.8 percent by 2018—just slightly above one
third of the 2.1 percent target. While most other measures are assessed as “in progress,” they are
subject to a number of implementation risks.
16.
In implementing and strengthening structural reforms, prioritization and sequencing
should be tailored to the macroeconomic context and country circumstances based on some
core principles. As emphasized above, the growth impact of structural reforms depends on the
complex interplay of their supply and demand effects, including their impact on confidence and
transitory costs (see Annex 2). Against this background, recent work at the IMF suggests that the
principles guiding successful structural reforms should be informed by an economy’s stage of
development and the distance to the frontier on structural performance, as well as its position in the
business cycle and the available macroeconomic policy space.
17.
The global economy needs bold multilateral actions to boost growth and contain risk.
The G20 must plan now for coordinated demand support using available fiscal space to boost public
investment and complement structural reforms, and act to implement forcefully the existing G-20

growth strategies. There is scope to go beyond the agreed strategies and introduce significant new
measures designed along the principles of successful reforms to further boost output.
18.
Promoting further trade integration is another area through which multilateral action
can promote efficiency and productivity gains. There is scope for further trade integration and
participation in global value chains. The G-20 can promote trade integration through multilateral
and, where appropriate, regional trade initiatives, and should buttress this with a strong
commitment to stop and roll back protectionist measures. The recent conclusion of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership is very welcome. But the challenge now is to establish a clear path forward for the
multilateral trade system, post-Doha, to advance integration at a more global level. An open
architecture that allows different speeds and depths of liberalization can advance trade integration,
especially if complemented by coordination among preferential and multilateral efforts so as to
avoid fragmenting the global trading system.
19.
Collective efforts should focus urgently on further enhancing the global financial
safety net and strengthening financial oversight. Given the high likelihood of spillovers in the
interconnected international financial system, the global safety net should be enhanced to better
manage the risks associated with capital flows. In particular, there may be a need to consider new
financing mechanisms to address the risks faced by commodity exporters and emerging markets
with strong fundamentals but high vulnerability to spillovers. Based on a stocktaking of membercountry experiences with capital-flow liberalization and management, the Fund will also conduct a
review this year of appropriate policies to effectively address financial-account risks, including
macro-prudential and capital flow management measures. Attention will focus on source as well as
recipient countries. Moreover, there remains a pressing need at the global level to complete and
implement the regulatory reform agenda. Advanced economies and emerging market economies
should also continue strengthening the regulation and supervision of rapidly expanding financial
activities outside the banking system.
20.
Finally, the G-20 needs to consider a new mechanism to contain geopolitical spillovers
that threaten the global recovery. Shocks of a non-economic origin—such as refugee flows
triggered by geopolitical conflicts and global epidemics—affect some countries and regions, and, if
left unchecked, could have significant spillover effects on the global economy. However, the world is
lacking a mechanism to handle these issues. Many countries at the center of such shocks are
shouldering a burden for others, with often limited capacity and fiscal space. Recognizing the global
public good nature of their actions, they could be backed up by a coordinated worldwide initiative
to provide financial support, with those at risk from such spillovers contributing necessary resources
and multilateral agencies, including the Fund, reassessing how they can best help channel those
resources to areas of most need.

Annex I. Spillovers from Slower Growth in China1
China’s transition to a slower yet more sustainable growth path would benefit global growth and
reduce tail risks. While the transition is proceeding broadly as expected, it is still fraught with
uncertainty and likely to entail significant spillovers through trade and commodities, which could be
amplified by financial channels. Economies most exposed to these spillovers are commodity exporters,
those within the Asian supply chain, and machinery exporters.
Nature of China’s slowdown. The current slowdown in China’s growth has been mainly driven by
investment and exports. The weakening in investment likely reflects a correction after an extended
period of very rapid growth. While the reasons for the slowdown in exports are still unclear, weak
external demand and the renminbi’s real appreciation up to August 2015 are believed to have
contributed to it. With investment relying heavily on imports of commodities and machinery, the
ongoing transition will likely result in weaker demand growth for these products.
Spillovers. China’s size and large footprint in global markets means that its transition will entail
global spillovers, especially through trade channels. These trade effects are both direct (reduced
demand for trading partners’ products) and indirect (impact on world prices for specific goods, for
example, commodities). They are likely to be reflected in the affected countries’ exchange rates and
asset markets.
Trade. This is the main channel through which developments in China affect the rest of the
world. China is one of the main trading partners (top

Commodities. China is a major importer across a range of
commodities, especially metals, for which it accounted for
around 40 percent of total global demand in 2014. The
slowdown has had a significant impact on the demand for
and prices of commodities. Metals prices have fallen
steadily since early 2011 (by almost 60 percent on
average). This has generated a large excess capacity in
mining sectors and forced exporters to adjust to an
environment of lower revenues. The January 2016 World
Bank commodity report highlighted that a 1 percentage
point drop in China’s growth could result in a 6 percent
average decline in commodity prices after two years.

Manufacturing. Excess capacity in some segments of the Chinese manufacturing sector can
contribute to lowering the prices of specific manufactured products (e.g., steel) and hence affect
China's competitors.



FDI. China’s direct investment abroad stood at around $1 trillion in June 2015 and accounted for
a significant share of recipient countries’ output. However, lower demand for commodities or a
bumpier-than-expected transition could reduce such investments.



Financial. While China’s capital controls limit direct financial spillovers on the rest of the world,
concerns about the speed at which China’s economy is slowing and uncertainty about the
authorities’ policy responses are having an impact on global markets, affecting equity prices,
exchange rates, and bond yields, and increasing volatility.

Exchange rates. Economies with export mixes similar to China’s would benefit (lose) through
trade from an appreciation (depreciation) of the renminbi. So, in general, would countries that
export to China, although those that sell it intermediate products for re-export could see these
effects muted or even reversed. The path of the renminbi during China’s transition will likely

in exchange markets can also affect corporates and households with large FX exposures.

Cross-border banking. BIS data on cross-border bank holdings show that foreign banks’ claims
on Chinese entities—including guarantees, derivatives contracts, and credit commitments—
stood at around $1 trillion in 2015 Q3, declining by about 15 percent compared to end-2014.
This exposure, though, remains small relative to source countries’ banking systems.

Annex II. The Growth Impact of Supply and Demand Policies2
Supply side policies will lift output over the longer term. However, while future gains from labor
and product market reforms and the channels through which they increase productivity, lower
unemployment, or raise labor force participation are fairly well documented, much less is known
about their short- to medium-term effects on aggregate output, employment, and inflation.3
Credible structural reforms can support short-term growth as well. In general, reforms that
strengthen confidence and lift expectations of future income have the potential to raise
consumption and investment. Moreover, some measures—such as active labor market policies or
lowering taxes on production inputs—can simultaneously deliver fiscal stimulus and, thereby, raise
domestic demand. On the product or services market side, lowering anti-competitive barriers to firm
entry can create new investment and hiring as new firms expand.
That said, some reforms can also inflict transitory costs due to frictions in labor and product
markets. For example, looser employment-protection legislation may induce firms to dismiss some
workers immediately, and these newly unemployed may need time to find jobs. As a result,
unemployment may increase, aggregate demand may decline, and output may contract for some
time (Cacciatore and others, 2015). Likewise, lowering entry barriers in non-tradable sectors may
lead incumbent firms to downsize quickly, whereas entry of new firms and the associated job
creation may be more gradual. Such short-run losses may be larger in periods of major economic
slack, where the willingness and ability of new firms to enter the market are weaker, and the
incentives for incumbent firms to lay off workers are stronger (Cacciatore and others, forthcoming).
Furthermore, if they imply falling wages and prices, reforms may increase the real interest rate in
countries where monetary policy is constrained, thereby weakening aggregate demand and delaying
recovery rather than speeding it up (Eggertsson and others 2014). This possibility is particularly
relevant in the current low inflation environment.
As a consequence, complementary demand-side policies may be needed to make supply-side
reform more effective and politically sustainable. In particular, such policies can frontload the
long-term gains of structural reforms and alleviate their short-run costs, particularly in periods of
weak growth. There are three inter-related, but conceptually distinct, channels through which
accommodative macroeconomic policies can raise the short-term response of output and
employment to reforms:


Amplifying structural reform effects. By improving overall business conditions,
macroeconomic policy stimulus alters the incentives of firms and workers in ways that make
their response to reform more growth-enhancing. Indeed, new IMF staff analysis based on a

from reforms in the context of the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process.

panel of advanced economies spanning four decades finds that job protection reforms have
more beneficial employment effects when accompanied by fiscal expansion, where fiscal
space exists (Duval and Furceri, forthcoming). This suggests that, in the presence of demandside support, firms are more willing to recruit new workers (and retain more existing
workers) when employment protection legislation is relaxed. Likewise, under fiscal stimulus,
new firms may be even more willing to enter markets when entry barriers are lowered; and
workers may be less likely to curtail consumption (because of precautionary saving motives
or because they face tighter liquidity constraints) if the level or duration of unemployment
benefits is cut.4


Being aware of multipliers. “Fiscal” structural reforms in the labor market, such as
reductions in labor tax wedges and increases in public spending on active labor market
policies, may have larger positive effects during periods of low growth and when not
accompanied by offsetting spending cuts or tax increases, provided there is fiscal space. This
is because such reforms entail a fiscal multiplier effect, which in general tends to be larger in
bad times (for instance, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012; Jorda and Taylor 2013; Abiad,
Furceri and Topalova 2015).



Anchoring inflation expectations. Structural reforms that can potentially increase supply
may have a short-term impact on prices. In light of this, amid persistent low inflation in
many countries, strong and credible monetary policy frameworks that keep medium-term
inflation expectations anchored and ease the zero lower bound constraint on policy rates—
including quantitative easing or negative deposit rates, where relevant—can pre-empt risks
that reforms create deflation, increase the real interest rate, and lower aggregate demand.

Bordon and others (forthcoming) find that supportive macroeconomic policies enhance the effect of product
market reforms to increase employment.
