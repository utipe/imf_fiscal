EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery remains on track, with some changes in its composition. While the U.S. economy
went through a soft patch early in the year, many European and Asian countries saw GDP expand faster than
expected, supported by a cyclical upturn in global manufacturing and trade. Emerging market financial
conditions have remained broadly supportive of growth even as U.S. monetary policy has gradually
tightened. At the same time, several emerging and advanced economies are still operating below capacity,
and underlying core inflation is still low generally. All in all, the global outlook remains broadly similar to the
April WEO.
This momentum comes, however, with rising vulnerabilities and continuing imbalances. China’s
growth has been robust, but it is fueled in part by rapid credit and fiscal expansion that aggravates financial
vulnerabilities—although measures are being taken to address the challenges. In some emerging markets,
corporate leverage is high and bank balance sheets fragile. In many advanced economies, very low interest
rates, high levels of non-performing loans related to weak corporate balance sheets, and business models
continue to restrict financial sector profitability. At the same time, global current account excess imbalances
persist, driving further divergence in countries’ net international investment positions.
Weak productivity growth and uneven distributions of economic gains limit growth going forward,
especially in advanced economies. The slow pace of economic reform and of private sector balance sheet
repair continue to depress investment and productivity growth, reinforcing headwinds from longer-term
trends such as aging populations, slowing innovation, and slow progress in raising female labor force
participation. Combined with insufficient support for those who bear the burden of adjustment to
technological change and global economic integration, these forces put a ceiling on future economic
prospects as the current cyclical boost runs its course.
While short-term risks have become more balanced, downside risks still dominate in the medium
term. The cyclical recovery could prove stronger and more durable than expected, but there is also negative
risk, including from policy uncertainty in advanced economies, financial sector vulnerabilities, and a sudden
sharp tightening in global financial conditions. A broad rollback of the strengthening of financial regulation
and oversight achieved since the crisis could lead to lower capital and liquidity buffers or weakened
supervisory stances, with negative repercussions for global financial stability. In the medium term, failure to
lift potential growth and make it more inclusive could damage social cohesion, and—in a self-defeating
feedback loop—make it even harder to find the political consensus for necessary reforms.
There is no time for standing still—policymakers will have to take tangible policy action to strengthen
and sustain the recovery while ensuring that it is resilient, well-balanced, and more inclusive:
 Strengthening the momentum. With countries at present facing divergent cyclical conditions, differing
stances of monetary and fiscal policy are likely to remain appropriate. In advanced economies where
demand is still lacking and inflation too low, monetary and (where feasible) fiscal support should
continue; elsewhere monetary policy should normalize gradually, in line with economic developments,
and fiscal policy should focus on supporting reforms aimed at expanding the economy’s supply
potential. Emerging markets should continue to allow exchange rates to buffer shocks, wherever
possible.
 Making growth resilient and balanced. Efforts to accelerate private sector balance sheet repair and ensure
sustainability of public debt are critical foundations for a resilient recovery. So are efforts from surplus
and deficit countries alike to reduce excess current account imbalances.
 Sustaining high and inclusive growth in the long term. This puts a priority on well-sequenced and tailored
structural reforms to boost productivity and investment, measures to narrow gender participation gaps,
and active support for those hurt by shifts in technology or trade.
 Working together. To maximize the benefits of global integration, a strong and rules-based multilateral
trade framework remains essential. It will be most effective if countries engage in a dialogue with a view
to modernizing and adapting the framework dynamically to the changing needs of the global economy.
International cooperation also plays a crucial role in strengthening the global financial system,
coordinating support for low-income countries, and tackling climate change and other collective
challenges.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
The global growth momentum remains on track. However, some of the forces driving the recovery are
adding to already high vulnerabilities and external imbalances. At the same time, weak productivity
growth and a lack of inclusiveness limit the growth outlook going forward. While the cyclical forces could
well be stronger than expected, they might also lose steam going forward—for example, if policy
uncertainty were to rise further. Other downside risks include an abrupt adjustment of financial
vulnerabilities and the risk of anti-globalization sentiment feeding into inward-looking policies.

A. THE CYCLICAL RECOVERY CONTINUES…
1.
The global recovery continues, even as the composition of growth is shifting among the
large economies. Growth outturns in the first quarter and high-frequency data generally confirmed
a strengthening of global activity, supported by a cyclical upturn in manufacturing, investment, and
stronger trade growth. Overall, this suggests a broadly

and 2018, after 3.1 percent in 2016. However, the

In advanced economies, the upswing is projected to
go on, even though cyclical positions still differ.
Prospects in the United States—where the expansion
is in its ninth year and the economy is at full
employment—are for steady but somewhat weaker
growth relative to the April WEO forecast, with
significant uncertainty regarding the expected
support from fiscal policy. At the same time, recent
indicators point to a slightly improved near-term
outlook for the euro area, helped by stronger
domestic demand and continued monetary
stimulus. There is still substantial slack, however, in
Italy as well as France. While output also remains
below potential in Japan, the size of the output gap
has been steadily narrowing following generally
strong growth in recent quarters, supported by a
favorable external environment and fiscal stimulus.
In emerging economies, the outlook remains for a
pick-up in growth, as external demand recovers and

several stressed commodity-exporting economies (including Russia and Brazil) continue to
stabilize. In China, policy support from expansionary credit and public investment as well as
supply-side reforms have helped maintain strong growth. With recent supervisory and regulatory
tightening, growth is expected to moderate in coming quarters, but remain at robust levels, in
part reflecting the recovering global economy. In India, the outlook has improved as the impact
of demonetization seems to be fading and recent key structural reforms continue to pay off.

B. …BUT IT COMES WITH VULNERABILITIES

However, the positive momentum comes with rising vulnerabilities. Specifically:

and asset price booms, although the authorities are
taking measures to contain these financial risks.
Among emerging economies elsewhere, reflecting
the long period of favorable financing conditions,
corporate leverage (e.g., in India, Indonesia, and
Turkey) and bank vulnerabilities (e.g., in India)
increased as well. Consequently, corporate defaults
have risen, especially in sectors with large increases
in leverage and adverse terms of trade
developments.

In advanced economies, low interest rates have
masked vulnerabilities, while high levels of liquidity,
together with an expectation of continuing policy accommodation, have suppressed volatility and
default risk. Investors have moved beyond traditional risk mandates in search for yield, while
borrowers have built up leverage. In many economies, including the euro area, low interest rates
and the flattening of the yield curve—combined with business model challenges and stubbornly
high non-performing loan (NPL) stocks —continue to put pressure on bank profitability, making
banks more prone to financial distress.

3.
Reducing excess external imbalances would make the recovery more resilient. While
current account imbalances can be healthy or even necessary—for example, as aging countries
accumulate savings or fast-growing economies draw in foreign investment funding—excess
imbalances can also be a symptom of undesirable policies or domestic distortions.1 Progress in
reducing such excess current account imbalances in systemic economies has stalled in recent years,
with deficits in, for instance, the United Kingdom and the United States, and surpluses in Germany,
Korea, Japan, and China. This configuration reflects multiple factors, including macroeconomic policies

and desirable policies as assessed by IMF staff (based on the IMF EBA methodology supplemented by staff judgement).

and structural distortions that constrain domestic demand or limit trade competition. For example,
fiscal policy has contributed to excess imbalances in some countries. Reversing this constellation
would contribute to more balanced and ultimately more resilient growth. In addition, it would help
limit diverging net foreign investment positions of key economies and, thereby, the need for larger
corrections in deficit economies through changes in flows and asset prices down the road. Large and
persistent imbalances can also add to strains on the multilateral trading system.

C. MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH PROSPECTS REMAIN LIMITED

The prospects for a further acceleration of global
potential growth—especially in advanced economies. In

possible slowing innovation at the technological frontier,
population aging, and decelerating global trade
integration. But the global financial crisis added to the

Medium-term prospects are further clouded
by rising inequality and, in advanced economies,
sluggish median real wages, which can undermine the

the sustainability of growth itself. Over the longer term,

discontent and affect the willingness to reform. IMF research suggests that the share of labor income
has been falling across advanced and emerging economies for over two decades. The causes are
complex and differ across country groups, but in advanced economies, the decline is concentrated
among low- and medium-skilled workers and is generally associated with higher income inequality.3
The trends are driven predominantly by technological change and exposure to routinization for
workers in advanced economies, while for emerging economies, global integration—specifically
participation in global value chains, which have
contributed to raising the capital intensity of production—

Gender gaps impact growth and inclusiveness.
In many parts of the world, large gender differences persist
in terms of economic/social opportunities and earnings.4
For example, despite some recent catch-up, gender gaps
in labor force participation rates are still large—at around
13 percentage points on average among advanced G-20
economies, and significantly larger in emerging G-20
economies. Gender gaps not only limit inclusiveness, they
also curtail labor supply and the potential for economic
growth.

D. RISKS ARE MORE BALANCED (ONLY) IN THE SHORT TERM
9.
Short-term risks are broadly balanced, but medium-term risks are still skewed to the
downside. While there is some potential for upside surprises to growth in the near term—for example,
if some of the cyclical forces underpinning the momentum prove stronger or more durable than
expected—the momentum could also falter. These downside risks include:


A more protracted period of policy uncertainty. Despite a drop in election-related risks, policy
uncertainty remains at a high level and could well rise further, reflecting—for example—difficultto-predict U.S. regulatory and fiscal policies, negotiations of post-Brexit arrangements, or
geopolitical risks. This could harm confidence, deter private investment, and weaken growth.



Financial tensions. In China, failure to address financial stability risks and curb excessive credit
growth could result in an unwanted, abrupt growth slowdown, with adverse spillovers to other
countries through trade, commodity price, and confidence channels. A faster-than-expected
monetary policy normalization in the United States could tighten global financial conditions and
trigger reversals in capital flows to emerging economies, along with U.S. dollar appreciation. This

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

would strain emerging economies with large leverage, U.S. dollar pegs, or balance sheet
mismatches. In some euro area countries, weak bank balance sheets and an unfavorable
profitability outlook could interact with higher political risks to reignite financial stability concerns.
Finally, a broad rollback of the strengthening of financial regulation and oversight achieved since
the crisis—both nationally and internationally—could lower capital and liquidity buffers or weaken
supervisory effectiveness, with negative repercussions for global financial stability.


Inward-looking policies. Over the longer term, failure to lift the growth potential and make it more
inclusive could fuel protectionism and hinder market-friendly reforms. The results could include
disrupted global supply chains, lower global output, and less affordable tradable consumer goods,
which harm low-income households disproportionately.

POLICIES
The policy challenge is to ensure strong, sustainable, and balanced growth that benefits all. This requires
adjusting short-term tools to the changing macroeconomic landscape, while taking decisive steps to
reduce vulnerabilities, including by accelerating balance sheet repair and making progress with external
rebalancing. Beyond the short term, efforts should focus on lifting the growth potential and making sure
growth is more broadly shared. Reinforcing multilateral cooperation is essential to maximize the gains
from economic integration.

A. SUSTAINING THE CYCLICAL MOMENTUM
10.
Securing the cyclical recovery requires calibrating the policy mix to changing cyclical
positions and carefully navigating the policy normalization process. In particular:

In the United States, monetary policy should
continue to gradually normalize and remain
data dependent, and plans for the Fed’s
balance sheet should be well-communicated;
fiscal policy should ensure that the ratio of
debt to GDP is on a downward path, while
supporting the longer-term potential of the
economy. In contrast, where inflation is still
below central bank targets and output gaps
remain negative, monetary policy should stay
supportive (Japan, euro area) and available

In emerging markets, wherever possible,
policymakers should continue to let the
exchange rate act as a buffer against shocks.
Where public debt is elevated, fiscal space
should be re-built through growth-friendly

B. STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE AND REDUCING IMBALANCES
11.
To strengthen resilience, emerging economies must continue to manage vulnerabilities
and rebuild policy buffers. This will help against possible external pressures, including from tighter
global financial conditions or policy uncertainty. Specifically:


Many countries have room to address corporate and bank vulnerabilities—through the
recognition of nonperforming assets, strengthening banks’ capital buffers, and improving
corporate debt-restructuring mechanisms. In China, recent policy efforts to contain financial
stability risks through supervisory tightening are welcome and should continue, fast-growing
nonfinancial sector debt should be tackled, and the move toward a healthier composition of
growth should accelerate, taking advantage of current strong momentum and the still-sizable
buffers to smooth the transition.



Commodity exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, should continue to adjust to the lower price
environment, including through adjusting fiscal policy as needed and making progress toward
diversifying their economies.

12.
The euro area must continue to improve the resilience of its banks and overcome
profitability challenges. Only a comprehensive and proactive approach to reducing NPLs can
adequately accelerate the repair of bank balance sheets and lift the drag on credit to the real economy.
Measures that could help reduce NPLs more quickly include extending ECB guidance on NPL
management to smaller banks, faster modernization and harmonization of insolvency regimes, and
having the European Commission provide a blueprint for national asset management companies that

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

could stimulate distressed debt markets. The recovery should help banks’ profitability, but further
business-model upgrading, cost rationalization, and consolidation, remain critical. Such steps should
be incentivized by a proactive approach to bank resolution where necessary. Faster progress is
needed to complete the Banking Union and advance the Capital Markets Union plan.
13.
Joint policy action by surplus and deficit economies would help address external
imbalances in a growth-friendly way benefiting all. For example, in the short term, some excesssurplus economies would benefit from using available fiscal space to boost public investment or
domestic demand more broadly (including Germany and Korea) helping also to reduce their excessive
current account surpluses. At the same time, excess-deficit economies such as the United States and
the United Kingdom should embark on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. To tackle structural
imbalances, advanced excess-surplus economies should implement policies to reduce barriers to
foreign competition and domestic investments in certain sectors, especially services, and to increase
labor force participation of the elderly. Excess-surplus emerging markets should focus on expanding
social safety nets and reducing direct and indirect obstacles to trade, including subsidies and other
forms of state support, for example to state-owned enterprises. Excess-deficit economies, on the other
hand, need to implement structural reforms to improve competitiveness, which may include wage
moderation in line with productivity growth. More generally, where monetary policy is constrained, as
in individual euro area members, fiscal and structural policies to facilitate relative price adjustments
should take priority.

C. LIFTING LONG-TERM GROWTH AND MAKING IT MORE INCLUSIVE
14.
Going forward, the key to a sustained recovery is to reinvigorate productivity and to
broaden economic opportunities for all. Weak productivity trends and a lack of inclusiveness put a
ceiling on the growth outlook as the cyclical boost runs its course. There is significant scope, however,
for progress along both dimensions. In many emerging and advanced economies (e.g., China,
Indonesia, United States), higher investment in education including through better use of public funds
would support growth in the longer term while opening opportunities and enabling both social
mobility and adjustment to structural economic shifts, including those arising from technology and
trade. In emerging markets, financial inclusion (India), fighting corruption (Mexico), and health care
reforms can have similar effects. In advanced economies, policy can offset negative output effects of
population aging by raising labor force participation (see below) and by boosting productive
infrastructure (Canada, Germany, United States) and R&D investment (Canada). For example, empirical
evidence suggests that an increase in public investment of 1 percent of GDP can lead to a mediumterm increase in the level of output of about 1½ percent in advanced economies.5
15.
Increasing female labor force participation can help improve growth prospects while
also making growth more inclusive. For example, recent estimates suggest that closing the gender
participation gap in the labor market by 25 percent by 2025—in line with the G-20 “25-25” target—

could increase annual GDP per capita growth rates by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points during the reform
period in several countries.6 Narrowing gender gaps is also vital to fostering inclusive growth and to
providing households, and women in particular, with more income security. Policy measures to foster
women’s participation in economic activities and their income security include increased support for

training programs). Ongoing IMF work and country experiences also suggest that the use of digital
technology holds the potential for better targeted and efficient fiscal policy, ensuring a reduction in
spending leakages and greater transparency.

D. WORKING TOGETHER
17.
A well-functioning multilateral framework for international economic relations is
another key ingredient of strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. Myopic pursuit of
zero-sum policies can only end by hurting all countries, as history shows. Because national policies

inevitably interact in a number of vital areas, creating strong spillovers across countries, the world
economy works far better for all when policymakers engage in regular dialogue and work within
agreed mechanisms to resolve disagreement.
18.
A rule-based and open world trading system is especially vital for global prosperity, but
it must be supported by domestic policies to facilitate adjustment, not only to trade but also
to a rapid pace of technological change. Global trade integration has proven to be a crucial engine
for enhancing productivity growth, living standards, and consumer choice, benefiting emerging and
advanced economies alike. Like growth stemming from innovation and technological progress,
however, gains from trade can create adjustment burdens that tend to fall disproportionally on some
individuals and communities. The asymmetric distribution of benefits and costs calls for strong
domestic policies to help adjustment.
19.
At the same time, the international community should continue to adapt the multilateral
system to the changing global economy. Active dialogue and cooperation will help to improve and
modernize the rules, while addressing valid country concerns. This process will ensure continued
mutual benefits and evenhandedness. Together with strong domestic policies, it will also help avoid
a broad withdrawal from multilateralism either through widespread protectionism or a competitive
race to the bottom in financial oversight, which would leave all countries worse off. Key reform areas
include:


Promoting trade. Further trade reforms in areas such as services and digital trade can make a
particularly strong contribution to growth, and innovations from bilateral and regional
agreements should eventually be brought to the global level. A global trading system anchored
in the World Trade Organization—with strong, well-enforced rules that continue to adjust to
promote competition and a level playing field—remains critical.7 As discussed above, maintaining
trade as a strong engine of growth, however, requires dedicated national efforts to help those
affected most by greater economic integration or technology.



Strengthening the global financial system. Maintaining robust financial regulatory regimes at the
national level, including in the United States, Europe, and China, has positive spillovers for global
financial stability. In addition, there is an urgent need for finalizing the international financial
regulatory reform agenda by tackling outstanding challenges, such as improving the regulation
and oversight of financial institutions, including non-banks; ensuring regulators have the capacity
to resolve globally systemic financial institutions; and strengthening the resilience of central
counterparty clearing for derivatives. Coordinated and collective action is also needed to manage
risks to financial stability from cyberattacks, money-laundering and terrorism financing, and
address the pressures that several countries have experienced in correspondent banking
relationships, which play a key role in facilitating global trade, remittances and economic activity.8

Finally, the high degree of interconnectedness in the international financial system and the
presence of vulnerabilities and excessive imbalances in some regions call for a more coordinated
and adequately resourced global financial safety net, as well as stronger frameworks for the
prevention and resolution of debt crises.


Continuing support for low-income countries. These countries continue to face the greatest needs
and a challenging economic environment, in some cases exacerbated by political uncertainty and
security issues. Helping low-income countries, by supporting the implementation of the
sustainable development goals and the 2030 development agenda, is not only an economic but
also a humanitarian question. The G-20 Compact with Africa initiative provides a key framework
for boosting private investment in the continent, helping foster higher income levels and
resilience, diversify economic structures, and promote inclusiveness.



Responding to non-economic challenges. The international community plays a crucial role in
fostering and coordinating financial and other types of support for countries most affected by
epidemics, natural disasters, famines, armed conflicts, and refugee flows. Climate change is a
causal factor behind all of these, while also posing other severe economic threats, and multilateral
cooperation to mitigate and adapt to its effects should be enhanced.
