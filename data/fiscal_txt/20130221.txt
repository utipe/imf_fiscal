EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Financial markets have rallied and near-term stability risks have eased in response to
better policies, but this is translating to activity very slowly. Decisive actions in the euro area
and the United States have contained the most immediate threats to the global recovery.
Financial markets have rallied and equity price volatility has fallen to pre-crisis levels. However,
lead indicators suggest that real activity will strengthen only gradually, as easier financial
conditions take time to transmit to the broader economy.
Despite an improving economy and better policies, significant downside risks remain.
These relate to the potential for stalled policy implementation in the euro area, unsustainable
public finances in the United States and Japan, and further growth disappointments in emerging
economies. However, there are also upside risks from better financial conditions and confidence.
Policymakers cannot afford to let up their efforts. While near-term threats have been
avoided, important medium-term challenges remain. The imperatives remain broadly
unchanged. Specifically:


The euro area should proceed towards a genuine economic and monetary union. Rolling
back financial fragmentation is also essential to improve the transmission of monetary
policy. This will require making tangible progress toward a banking union with greater
fiscal integration.



In advanced economies, fiscal consolidation needs to continue at a gradual and sustained
pace, supported by accommodative monetary policy. Fiscal adjustment and targets in
most advanced economies are broadly appropriate. Consolidation must be supported by
the adoption and implementation of concrete medium-term consolidation plans in the
United States and Japan, where the recently-announced stimulus makes this even more
urgent. U.S. authorities should act early and decisively to durably raise the debt ceiling
and avert automatic spending cuts. More generally, advanced economies need to curtail
rising age-and health-related spending.



Policy responses for emerging economies vary. With short-term risks to activity abating,
the general challenge is to rebuild fiscal space. Some emerging economies can afford to
maintain current monetary policy settings, while others may have to gradually tighten. In
countries with strong capital inflows or still-elevated credit growth, supervisory and
macroprudential measures should be deployed to curb sectoral excesses.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS & OUTLOOK

Financial market conditions have improved considerably as policy action bolstered confidence
and helped mitigate near-term risks. Improved financial conditions, however, are only slowly
translating to the broader economy. Prospects are for a gradual reacceleration of activity.
1.
Financial market conditions are much improved. Markets have rallied on a broad
front in response to strengthening policies and prospects. Since July 2012, equity prices in
advanced and emerging markets have gained some 15 percent and equity price volatility has
fallen to pre-crisis levels, while high-yield bond issuance in the United States has significantly
surpassed pre-crisis levels. Periphery sovereign spreads, though still elevated, have dropped
appreciably (by some 200 bps for Italy and Spain) and, for the first time in a year, some
periphery economies have successfully placed large volumes of medium- to long-term
syndicated bonds. Capital flows to emerging economies picked up again and risk spreads on
their sovereign and corporate bonds declined further. Syndicated loan issuance reached high
levels and an increasing share of borrowing is foreign currency denominated. Nevertheless,
the limited increase in safe-haven yields continues to point to caution among bond
investors.

adjustment fatigue in the periphery or reform complacency in general, could renew
pressures on banks and sovereign funding. Prospects are better in the United States,
because of a healthier housing market and greater adjustment in household and bank
balance sheets. However, critical decisions still need to be made on the short-and long-term
path of fiscal policy. Japan still lacks a credible plan to ensure fiscal sustainability, and
remains hobbled by deflation. Activity is stronger in emerging and developing economies,
but even there developments have disappointed in Brazil and India. Overall, global growth
projections have been marked down modestly in the January WEO Update.
3.
Looking ahead, global activity will be supported by easier financing conditions
and better confidence.


Accommodative monetary conditions will continue to support the recovery. Financial
conditions in the euro area improved following the ECB’s announcement of Outright
Monetary Transactions (OMT). The Fed has enhanced its forward guidance to
emphasize that the fed funds rate will remain exceptionally low at least as long as the
unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, near term inflation (between 1 and
2 years ahead) is projected to be no more than 2½ percent, and longer-term
inflation expectations remain in check. The Fed has also replaced Operation Twist
with new purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. The Bank of Japan recently
shifted to an open-ended asset purchase program and strengthened its resolve to
exit deflation by adopting a 2 percent inflation target. In emerging economies, many
central banks postponed monetary tightening.



In advanced economies, easy monetary conditions will translate slowly into more
dynamic lending, provided financial stability risks continue to abate. In the United
States, credit growth is picking up and bank lending conditions are easing slowly,
supported by recovering house prices, greater loan demand from households, and
stronger bank balance sheets and profitability. In the euro area, however, bank
lending remains weak and is unlikely to recover rapidly. Despite improved funding
conditions following the OMT, many nonfinancial corporations struggle with weak
demand and impaired balance sheets, while many banks remain under strain from
lingering concerns about capital or asset quality and their underlying business
models. In this setting, while progress on national adjustment should lead to greater
traction of monetary policy in the periphery, low policy rates will gain only limited
traction in the near term, and financial fragmentation is unlikely to reverse quickly.



In emerging economies, financial conditions will ease in the short run but monetary
and macroprudential policies may have to tighten. The credit cycle is in an advanced
stage. While policy rate hikes and macroprudential measures have successfully
reduced very high credit growth since 2006, reaccelerating activity and capital inflows

4
are likely to boost loan demand and loosen credit standards. Accordingly, monetary
policy may well have to become more neutral, while macroprudential measures
target excesses in certain sectors.
4.
Fiscal policy may weigh on activity somewhat less than previously expected,
owing mainly to a change of stance in Japan. In 2013, the amount of fiscal withdrawal in
advanced economies will be some ¾ percent of GDP, which is similar to 2012. Japan’s fiscal
stance was expected to be contractionary in 2013 with the unwinding of reconstructionrelated spending. However, faced with a deteriorating economic outlook and to support the
higher inflation target, the new government has introduced a stimulus equivalent to about
1½ percent of GDP, spread over fiscal years 2012-14. Euro area fiscal policy will tighten less
in 2013 than in 2012, and U.S. fiscal policy will tighten somewhat more—this assumes that
the sequester (½ percentage point of GDP) is postponed beyond 2013 and a durable
solution to raising the debt ceiling is achieved. In emerging economies, fiscal policy is
expected to remain close to neutral. While the fiscal positions of these economies are
generally healthy, they have not yet reached the pre-crisis surpluses that allowed them
ample space to respond to the fall in global demand. Also, some economies continue to face
significant fiscal challenges.
5.
Against this background, global growth is projected to increase only gradually
over the near term. On an annual average basis, global real GDP growth is projected to
reach 3½ percent in 2013 (up from 3¼ percent in 2012) and increase further to 4 percent in
2014. In advanced economies, the acceleration is expected to be more evident in the second
half of 2013 as easier financial conditions and less uncertainty about policies and prospects
foster a rebound in investment. In emerging economies, improvements in activity are
expected to become more broad based: growth has already returned to a healthy pace in
China, solid consumption and policy improvements are expected to lift activity in India, and
still-strong consumption and a recovery in investment, including infrastructure, should
support faster growth in Brazil. Accordingly, activity in these economies is projected to
accelerate from around 5 percent in the first half of 2012 to 5½ percent and then 6 percent
in 2013–14. Recent improvements to structural policies will also help bolster growth over the
medium term.

II. KEY RISKS
Some upside risks have emerged as policy actions have avoided tail risks. However, important
downside risks and medium-term challenges remain. Concerns relate to the potential for
stalled policy implementation in the euro area, unsustainable public finances in the United
States and Japan, and further growth disappointments in emerging economies.
8.
Risks have become more symmetric in the short term. The ECB’s OMT has
lowered important tail risks relating to the viability of euro. The U.S. fiscal cliff has largely
been avoided, while latest developments suggest that the risk of a hard landing has receded
in China. Accordingly, the improved financial conditions and confidence could trigger
stronger-than-projected global investment and growth.
9.

However, important downside risks remain.



A stalling of policy implementation represents a key risk in the euro area. On the back
of remaining near- and medium-term challenges, stalled policy commitment and
implementation would weigh against financial market sentiment and growth and
could rekindle investor flight. Over the medium term, a concern is a protracted
period of stagnation or low growth, as high spreads and debt overhang of the
private sector in the periphery depress investment and potential growth.



Unsustainable fiscal positions in the United States and Japan over the medium term
represent another major risk. Fiscal sustainability concerns are even more pertinent
for Japan and have risen with the recent announcement of additional fiscal stimulus.
In the United States, the absence of a deal on durably raising the debt ceiling
increases the threat of financial market turmoil. Upward pressure on interest rates
from deteriorating fiscal conditions could be substantial, and risk perceptions can
change suddenly, undermining financial stability.



Lower expectations for medium-term growth for some emerging economies could come
with further cutbacks in investment and capital outflows, reducing short-term growth.
After many years of strong investment and growth, fueled by rapid credit expansion
and capital inflows, medium-term prospects for major emerging economies are
subject to vulnerabilities from still-high asset prices and stretched financial sectors.
At the same time, potential output in these may be lower than assumed.

7

III. POLICY IMPERATIVES
Policymakers should not become complacent in response to improving financial conditions.
The imperatives remain broadly unchanged.
10.
In the euro area, EMU-wide policies should support individual countries’ efforts
to repair public and private balance sheets and implement structural reforms to
restore competitiveness. Reversing financial fragmentation (e.g., reducing financial home
bias, improving cross-border bank flows; reducing credit spreads in the periphery) is
essential to improve the transmission of monetary policy as well as foster sustainable
growth. This will require making tangible progress toward a genuine economic monetary
union—starting with a banking union with greater fiscal integration. Key elements are:


Further repair of bank balance sheets. Domestically systemic banks should be
recapitalized and non-viable ones resolved. Direct equity injections through the ESM
would be instrumental for severing adverse bank-sovereign feedback loops when
bank recapitalization threatens public debt sustainability. This should move alongside
faster progress on the single supervisory mechanism.



Timely implementation of a more complete banking union with an integrated
regulatory and supervisory structure. A full banking union should eventually have a
single supervisory-regulatory framework, a pan euro-area resolution mechanism with
a common fiscal backstop, and a pan euro-area deposit guarantee scheme. Building
blocks have already been outlined and are being put in place. Implementation raises
challenges that should not be underestimated.

11.
Fiscal consolidation needs to continue at a gradual and sustained pace. Fiscal
adjustment in most advanced economies is broadly appropriate. Fiscal targets should be
pursued in structural rather than nominal terms, ensuring that negative growth surprises do
not trigger additional consolidation efforts (in the euro area, the current fiscal framework
provides sufficient flexibility and should be used appropriately). Countries facing higher debt
or greater market pressure are generally adjusting more than their advanced economy
peers. In the event of large negative shocks or growth disappointments, the current fiscal
policy stance may need to be reassessed in countries that can afford it. Policymakers need to
focus on following issues:


U.S. authorities should act early and decisively to find a durable solution to raising the
debt ceiling and avert automatic spending cuts. If a resolution is not found, confidence
in U.S. policymakers could rapidly erode, with potentially large spillovers to the rest
of the world.

8


Fiscal adjustment must be supported by the adoption and implementation of concrete
medium-term consolidation plans. The recently-announced stimulus by Japan makes
this even more urgent. Despite progress made so far, U.S. policymakers should agree
on a comprehensive plan that includes both higher revenues and contains
entitlement spending. More generally, in advanced economies, growth in public
health care spending is on an unsustainable trajectory (with projections indicating
increases in net present value terms of close to 100 percent of GDP). Thus, it is
important for advanced economies to move early to curtail rising age- and healthrelated spending to ensure debt sustainability.

12.
Monetary policy in the major advanced economies should remain
accommodative. Fears of high inflation appear overstated—central banks have the tools
needed to mop up liquidity and tighten their policy stance should inflation expectations
unexpectedly rise. Nevertheless, there is a concern about diminishing effectiveness of
unconventional actions, their side effects (e.g., volatile capital flows), and potential difficulties
related to unwinding them. While advanced economy central banks can likely address shortterm issues related to policy normalization given their large balance sheets, they should
continue to monitor any unintended consequences of their policies on sovereign-bank
linkages, corporate leverage, financial innovation, international capital flows, and asset price
bubbles.


In Japan, more resolve is required to durably exit deflation. The Bank of Japan recently
announced a 2 percent inflation target and a switch to open-ended asset purchases.
These are steps in the right direction but stronger commitment and more effective
communication are also needed. This should be accompanied by stronger action,
such as substantially expanding its asset purchase program.



In the United States, further repair of household balance sheets is needed, as middleincome households, who were hurt severely by the housing bust, have made limited
progress in repairing their balance sheets. In the euro area, improving the
effectiveness of monetary policy will require the broad range of policies discussed
above to reverse financial fragmentation. In the meantime, there is some room for a
lower policy rate.

13.
Policy requirements differ among emerging economies. With short-term risks to
activity abating, the general challenge is to rebuild policy space, as medium-term growth
dynamics now appear less favorable than before the crisis. Specifically:


Fiscal buffers should be rebuilt over time. While emerging economies generally have
much lower public debt than advanced economies, the healthy debt dynamics in
many of these economies is largely due to negative interest-growth differentials,

9
which allow debt ratios to remain stable despite the presence of primary fiscal
deficits. Thus, fiscal positions must be strengthened while balancing external
downside risks against risks from rising domestic imbalances. Medium-term fiscal
targets should be more ambitious in some countries (e.g., Russia: to reduce the nonoil deficit; Turkey: to support external adjustment), policy should remain embedded
in existing frameworks in Brazil, while India needs substantial fiscal reform to better
anchor medium-term consolidation. By contrast, economies that have sufficient fiscal
space (e.g., China) can use discretionary fiscal stimulus with a view to facilitating the
needed rebalancing of the economy towards consumption should downside risks
materialize.


Some emerging economies can afford to maintain current monetary policy settings or
ease if downside risks materialize, while others may have to take measures to gradually
tighten financial conditions. Some emerging economies should remain watchful of
inflationary pressures and should not lower interest rates further. Policymakers in
Brazil should begin unwinding monetary stimulus as the recovery proceeds to ensure
inflation expectations remain well anchored. Room for monetary easing is also more
limited where strong credit expansion continues, or where currencies are
undervalued. In countries with still-elevated credit growth, supervisory and macroprudential measures should be deployed to curb sectoral excesses.

14.
Global imbalances have narrowed considerably but old challenges remain
unaddressed. Much of the adjustment in global imbalances came from demand
compression in crisis-stricken deficit economies, rather than from necessary fiscal and
structural adjustments. Similarly, the decline in euro area imbalances has been driven by
lower demand and higher exports in the periphery and unit labor costs have moderated
because of rising productivity in response to labor shedding and wage moderation including
nominal cuts in some. Further policy action is needed in both deficit and surplus economies
to avoid a prolonged period of low global growth. China needs to continue to promote
greater consumption-driven growth and Germany needs reforms to boost domestic
demand, notably investment. Reserve accumulation by China has appropriately slowed
down. Going forward, it will be important to continue to allow the market to play a stronger
role in determining the exchange rate. The United States should raise its saving rate further,
particularly through more fiscal consolidation. Other deficit economies need further fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms to boost competitiveness, particularly in the euro area
periphery.
