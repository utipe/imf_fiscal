EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery is being threatened by intensified sovereign, financial, and real sector feedback loops.
Activity will lose steam through 2012, but a collapse should be avoided. In G-20 advanced economies, the euro area
will experience a mild recession through 2012. In the United States, growth is expected to moderate following the
recent pick-up, which was supported in part by lower household saving. Other major advanced economies will
suffer from weak and uneven growth. In G-20 emerging economies, the moderation in growth from high levels is
expected to continue in 2012, reflecting past policy tightening and adverse spillovers from advanced economies.
Downside risks to global growth have escalated. The overarching risk remains an intensified “paradox of thrift” as
households, firms, and governments globally reduce demand. The prospect of multiple equilibria—particularly with
respect to market perceptions of sovereign debt sustainability in the euro area—has intensified this risk. Other key
risks include hard landings in emerging economies and a sharply higher oil price, driven by geopolitical-related
disruptions to the supply of crude oil.
Europe must pursue its move beyond its piecemeal approach and achieve a successful resolution of the crisis
through four key steps. Fiscal consolidation structured and paced to avoid a collapse in demand, with the focus on
the size of the cyclically-adjusted effort; countries with policy space should consider holding off adjustment in 2012.
Stronger growth, by offsetting the adverse effect of fiscal consolidation on growth with other policies: easier
monetary policy, including lower ECB policy rates; bank recapitalization; and structural reforms to address the root
causes of the crisis and bolster market confidence. Enhanced crisis management, by providing sufficient funding
through expanded use of the ECB’s balance sheet and adding real resources for the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Deeper fiscal and financial integration across Europe to
underpin the sustainability of the common currency.
In other G-20 advanced economies, there remains an urgent priority to set out a credible path for fiscal
consolidation over the medium term. In the near term, sufficient adjustment is planned in most advanced
economies. If downside risks to growth materialize, countries with adequate space should allow automatic
stabilizers to operate fully, and those that can afford it, may consider slowing the pace of near-term consolidation,
while maintaining their commitment to credible medium-term consolidation. Monetary policy should remain highly
accommodative, and policymakers should stand ready to continue or expand unconventional measures, if needed.
In G-20 emerging economies, the immediate policy priority is to ensure a soft landing as domestic growth
and demand from advanced economies moderate. Monetary policies can be eased in economies with
diminishing inflationary pressure (e.g., Latin America), but with sufficient safeguards to insure against overheating in
some sectors (e.g., real estate). Social spending can be increased in economies where inflation is low, public debt is
not high, and external surpluses are large (e.g., China). Policy space is more limited in those economies that suffer
from both relatively high inflation and public debt, warranting a more cautious stance toward policy easing (e.g.,
India).
Collective action to address persistent global imbalances can better guarantee a return to strong,
sustainable, and balanced global growth. This will require further deleveraging of households in advanced deficit
economies and more inclusive growth and lower saving in emerging surplus economies. The latter can be achieved
by alleviating distortions, notably financial sector reform as well as enhanced pension, healthcare, and education
systems, complemented with less intervention in foreign exchange markets.

I. GLOBAL CONJUNCTURE
The global recovery is under threat. Financial conditions have deteriorated, global growth prospects
for 2012 have dimmed, and downside risks have escalated, notably the threat of intensified
sovereign-financial feedback and financial sector deleveraging that could inflict widespread damage
to the real economy. The euro area has entered recession and other G-20 advanced economies are
experiencing weak and bumpy growth, reflecting legacies from the crisis and spillovers from Europe.
G-20 emerging economies are slowing by more than expected, as the effects of past policy
tightening are hitting their economies at the same time as spillovers from advanced economies.
1.
Global activity is slowing. Recent
indicators show a marked deterioration from
the relatively robust third quarter of 2011,
during which global GDP expanded at an
annualized rate of 3½ percent. During this
period, growth in the advanced economies
surprised on the upside, as consumers in the
United States unexpectedly lowered their

saving rates and business fixed investment
showed strength, supply-chain disruptions
after the Japan earthquake unwound more
quickly than anticipated, and stabilizing oil
prices helped support consumption. But these
factors are likely to boost growth only
temporarily and financial conditions have
worsened significantly in the meantime. Broad
indicators of global activity—including trade—
are confirming that growth during the final
quarter of 2011 turned out lower than
projected in the September 2011 WEO.
2.
Growth in G-20 emerging economies
is slowing more than expected. This may
reflect past policy tightening and weaker
fundamental growth. At the same time,
adverse spillovers from G-20 advanced
economies are beginning to wash ashore. In
some major emerging economies domestic
demand has cooled more than expected.
These effects have been amplified by weaker
confidence in the outlook for growth as the
external environment has deteriorated.
Indeed, evidence of adverse spillovers from
advanced economies is building, with trade
serving as the main transmission channel.
Export growth for emerging economies is now
contracting at an annual rate after expanding
by between 30–40 percent earlier in 2011. The
sharpest declines have been recorded in
emerging Europe, reflecting close linkages to
the euro area.

markets still tight, this has reduced the
immediate pressure on banks by lowering the
need to rollover. At the same time, the EU
made commitments at the recent summit to
strengthen the euro area’s policy framework.
But the lack of a comprehensive approach to
resolve the sovereign debt crisis, coupled with
a weaker focus on measures to boost growth,
have dampened the positive effect on market
confidence.

3.
Recent policy advances in the euro
area, in response to market pressures, have
prevented a calamitous collapse in
confidence and financial stability so far. The
most tangible effect has come from the
enhanced liquidity facilities offered by the
ECB,
including
extended
refinancing
operations and the acceptance of a broader

4.
Sovereign stress in parts of the euro
area remains very elevated, sustaining
adverse feedback loops with the financial
sector and the real economy. Doubts about
placing public finances on a sustainable track
have kept sovereign yields in countries under
market scrutiny high, putting pressure on
banks’ balance sheets. The ECB’s long-term
refinancing operation (LTRO) program, while
designed to provide liquidity support to
banks, appears to have offered some support
at the short end of the sovereign yield curve
for the euro area countries under market
stress, largely reflecting increased demand for
sovereign debt from the banks with enhanced
access to funding (including for collateral). The
effect on long-term bonds has been limited
however, with yields remaining at dangerously
high levels (at about 7 percent for Italy and
somewhat lower for Spain). Sovereign CDS
spreads have also remained high and near
recent peaks, including for the core countries
of the euro area. Higher sovereign yields are
feeding through to increased private sector
borrowing costs.

rather than increasing the level of capital. To
avoid excessive deleveraging, the EBA has
stated that any reductions in risk weighted
assets as a means of attaining the target
should be agreed only insofar as these are
effected through the sale of selected assets.
6.
Amid a general flight to safety,
emerging market exchange rates have
resumed their depreciation against the U.S.
dollar and asset prices have fallen.
Depreciations have been broad across
countries with flexible exchange rates, with
particular currency weakness in those
economies in close geographical proximity to
the euro area. At the same time, portfolio
capital is still flowing out of emerging
markets, but at a markedly slower pace than
during late 2008 or during August-September
2011. This is contributing to a modest
worsening in financial conditions, as reflected
in lower equity prices and higher external
bond spreads.

Crude oil prices have held up in
the face of lower global growth and
demand prospects, but other commodity
prices have extended their decline. The oil
market has remained relatively tight, due
mainly to temporary supply constraints in
non-OPEC producers. At the same time,
geopolitical risks have increased, raising
precautionary demand for oil inventories and
adding a risk premium to spot prices. Other
commodity markets have been quick to

metals, while food prices have declined
mainly due to the prospects for buoyant
supply in 2012.

II. PROSPECTS
8.
Recovery will stall in many
economies during 2012, but a collapse
should be avoided. The euro area is entering
a mild recession that will endure through
2012. Other advanced major economies will
suffer from weak and uneven growth.
Emerging economies will experience a further
moderation in the pace of recovery. But this
baseline is predicated on the assumption that
policymakers in the euro area meet their
commitments with increased urgency to
stabilize the crisis in 2012. This would allow for
a gradual normalization of sovereign bond
premiums and would limit the deleveraging
by euro area. Credit and investment in the
euro area contract modestly, with limited
financial and trade spillovers to other regions.



Growth in the United States is expected to
slow during the course of 2012, after
stronger domestic dynamics initially make
up for negative spillovers from the euro
area. The recent pick-up in private
consumption has been largely fueled by a
decline in saving and is unlikely to be
sustained in the absence of a marked
improvement in the labor market and
household incomes. At the same time, the
recovery of household net wealth remains
tepid on the back of broadly stagnating
equity prices and house prices that remain
close to their post-crisis lows. The
prospect
of
stepped-up
fiscal
consolidation would also constrain
growth.

Global output is projected to expand by
about 3½ percent in 2012 (Table 1)—a
downward revision of about ¾ percentage
points relative to the September 2011
World Economic Outlook (WEO). Growth
has been marked down for both advanced
and emerging economies, with a large
divergence in the growth levels persisting
between both regions.



In Japan reconstruction following the
earthquake will support activity, but at the
same time weaker global trade growth
and strong yen will mean that overall
growth will remain low at about 1¾
percent in 2012, a downward revision of ½
percentage points from the September
WEO.



In emerging and developing economies
growth is expected at 5¾ percent—a
significant slowdown from the 6¾ percent
growth registered in 2010-11 and about
½ percentage point lower than in the
September 2011 WEO. This reflects past
policy tightening (e.g., Brazil), domestic
policy slippages that have hit confidence
(such as India) and adverse spillovers from
advanced economies. Stalling global trade
growth, lower commodity prices, and
reduced portfolio capital flows (and likely
net outflows) will all further slow the pace





The euro area is expected to enter a
recession with activity projected to
contract by ½ percent in 2012.
Contributing factors include the increase
of sovereign and corporate bond yields
and an accelerated program of fiscal
consolidation. Sovereign-financial sector
feedback is amplifying these effects, as
banks exposed to government bonds and
weakening real economies delever their
balance sheets, further tightening credit
conditions.

of recovery. The effects of these factors
will vary somewhat across regions and
countries,
reflecting
linkages
with
advanced economies, but also the extent
to which policies serve to cushion the
impact. China’s economy has, once again,
shown its resilience and appears to be
coasting to a modest slowdown.
Nevertheless, the external environment is
weakening and growth is projected to
moderate by about 1 percentage point to
8¼ percent in 2012.

damaging deflation have increased in some
G-20 advanced economies. Futures markets
now anticipate that most key commodity
prices will remain broadly unchanged, while
risks for non-energy commodities are broadly
on the downside.


In G-20 advanced economies, ample
economic slack and
well-anchored
inflation expectations will keep inflation
pressures subdued, as the effect of last
year’s higher commodity prices wanes.
Inflation is projected to recede to close to
1½ percent during 2012, down from a
peak of about 2¾ percent in 2011. Should
growth turnout lower than expected, there
is a risk that very large output gaps would
lead to deflation in some countries, with
damaging consequences where debt
burdens remain high.

In G-20 emerging economies, inflationary
pressures are also expected to drop, as growth
slows and food price inflation declines.
However, inflation is expected to remain
persistent in some regions. Overall, consumer
prices in these economies are projected to
decelerate, with inflation reaching 6¼ percent
in the course of 2012, down from 7½ percent
last year.

III. KEY RISKS
Downside risks to global growth have escalated. The overarching risk remains an intensified global
“paradox of thrift” as households, firms, and governments around the world reduce demand, with
many advanced economies unable to lower policy rates further. Credibility issues and fertile ground
for multiple equilibria—self-fulfilling outcomes of pessimism or optimism, particularly with respect
to sovereign debt sustainability in the euro area—have only intensified this risk. Emerging
economies now face greater risks of a hard landing, stemming from home-grown vulnerabilities and
adverse spillovers from advanced economies.
10.
The key risk remains that policies
fail to shift Europe gradually towards a
“good equilibrium”, failing to break the
adverse feedback loops between real,
fiscal, and financial sectors. This risk is
immediate as euro area public sector and
bank debt rollover needs during 2012 are
large (cumulative at about 16 percent of GDP).
Successful debt issuance will require a durable
recovery of market confidence about the
prospects for both growth and fiscal
sustainability across the euro area.

Intensified
adverse
sovereignfinancial feedback loops in the euro area
would accelerate bank deleveraging,
entailing sizeable contractions in credit and
output, and potentially large global
spillovers. The scenario embodies an
additional contraction in credit (€500 billion)
coinciding with sharp fall in private investment
(almost 2 percent of GDP). The resulting
adverse impact on growth intensifies fiscal
sustainability concerns, driving up sovereign
risks premia (by 100 basis points from present
levels) and forcing even more front-loaded
fiscal consolidation (1 percent of GDP). The
adverse impact of these developments is
amplified by the fact that monetary policy is
constrained by the zero lower bound on
interest rates. As a result, the level of euro
area output is lower by about 4 percent

relative to the WEO forecast after 2 years (see
Table 1 for the WEO baseline). Assuming that
financial contagion to the rest of the world is

spillovers via international trade, the level of
global output is lower than the WEO projects

consolidation measures would go some
way toward reducing the budget deficits,
but they do not address the underlying
spending pressures from public health
care and pension programs, and do not
raise any new revenue. An accident-prone
political economy could result in
damaging fiscal tightening in the short
run, as key measures to support the
economy lapse in the face of a political
impasse.

Debt sustainability remains a threat
to the outlook in the United States and
Japan. In the short run, this risk might be
mitigated as the turbulence in the euro area
makes government debt of these economies
more attractive for investors. However, as long
as public debt levels are projected to rise over
the medium term, and in the absence of welldefined and credible fiscal consolidation
strategies, there is the possibility of turmoil in
global bond and currency markets. As
developments in the euro area have shown,
market confidence can be lost quickly with
damaging consequences for growth and
financial stability, underscoring that time is of
the essence.

proposal for tax and social security reform
bill is welcome, but an agreement on the
details needs still to be reached. More
importantly, further fiscal consolidation to
the one proposed in the bill is needed to
secure fiscal sustainability.

13.
In key emerging economies the
risks stem from the possibility of a hard
landing, on the back of uncertain potential
growth, and spillovers from advanced
economies. In a number of major emerging
economies credit expanded at a brisk pace
over the past couple of years, increasing
financial vulnerabilities. The resulting buoyant
demand may have led to an overestimation of
underlying growth in these economies. If the
gains in real estate prices and credit were to
unwind, triggered by a loss of confidence, the
impact on activity could be damaging. The
effect could be exacerbated by adverse
external developments. Export growth in

11
emerging economies has already stalled
(particularly for emerging Asia), and weakerthan-expected demand from advanced
economies, as the experience of 2008-09
showed, could trigger much sharper falls.
Substantially weaker global demand would
also lower oil and commodity prices, adversely
affecting exporters. Until now, the financial
spillovers from turbulence in advanced
economies have been modest, but previous
experience
underscores
that
financial
conditions can change quickly. A sudden stop
or reversal of capital flows, reduced availability
of trade finance, or liquidity pressures in
domestic financial systems due to widespread
counterparty risk aversion could rapidly
materialize.
14.
Emerging economies also face risks
of domestic policy missteps. Specifically:


Policy space is much reduced compared to
2008 and the capacity of emerging
economies to respond forcefully to

adverse spillovers is lower. In some
economies, fiscal space is reduced by
relatively high deficits and debt levels that
increased due to aggressive stimulus
during the crisis (e.g., India). In others,
monetary
stimulus
could
further
exacerbate imbalances in the economy
that built up during 2009-10 (including a
credit, property, and construction boom in
China).


The global environment has become less
forgiving of policy slippages, including on
structural reforms that correct domestic
distortions and contribute to balanced
growth. Delayed implementation of
structural reforms (including India’s recent
decision to delay liberalization of its
domestic multi-brand retail sector) has
adversely impacted domestic confidence
at the same time as uncertainties
regarding
external
demand
have
increased.

12
BOX. OIL PRICE RISKS
Concerns about geopolitical oil supply risks are again increasing. Iran-related risks stand out
since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released its update on the country’s nuclear
program in mid-November, although geopolitical risks are broader and also apply to Iraq, Syria,
South Sudan, and Nigeria.
The likelihood of an Iran-related supply disruption remains difficult to determine, but recent
price developments suggest that oil markets assign a low, albeit rising, probability (chart).
Concerns about large-scale, potentially unprecedented disruptions are based on the following
considerations:




Iran is the world’s 5th largest producer, extracting
3½ million barrels a day (mbd), around 5 percent of
global production and the 3rd largest exporter of
crude oil.
Iran’s location at a key oil supply route (the Strait of
Hormuz), where production capacity is concentrated
and through which about 40 percent of global oil
exports and one-fourth of global production is
shipped. A blockade would also neutralize a large
part of current OPEC spare capacity. Alternative
routes exist, but only for a tiny fraction of the
amounts shipped through the Strait, and they may
take
some
time
to
operationalize
while
transportation costs would rise significantly.

The oil market impact of intensified concerns about an Iran-related oil supply shock (or an
actual disruption) would be large, if not compensated by supply increases elsewhere. Financial
flow sanctions imposed by some OECD countries against Iran may be tantamount to an oil embargo
and would imply supply declines of around 1.5 mbd, comparable with the average decline during
major disruptions since the first oil shock and to the setbacks to Libyan production in 2011. A
blockade of the Strait of Hormuz would constitute, and be perceived by markets to presage, sharply
heightened global geopolitical tension involving a much larger and unprecedented disruption. A
supply disruption would likely have a large effect on prices, not only reflecting relatively insensitive
supply and demand in the short run but also the current state of oil market buffers. In particular,
OECD inventory buffers are below average due to tight oil market conditions through much of 2011,
and excluding Iran, spare capacity of OPEC producers is close to the average of the past decade, at
about 3.8 mbd (5.2 percent of global crude oil production). A halt of Iran’s exports to OECD
economies without offset from other sources would likely trigger an initial oil price increase of
around 20-30 percent (about $20-30 a barrel currently), with other producers or emergency stock
releases likely providing some offset over time. A Strait of Hormuz closure could trigger a much
larger price spike, including by limiting offsetting supplies from other producers in the region.

13

IV. POLICIES
The three requirements for a more resilient recovery are sustained but gradual adjustment; ample
liquidity and easy monetary policy, mainly in advanced economies; and more confidence in
policymakers’ ability to act decisively. Importantly, not all countries should adjust in the same way,
to the same extent, or at the same time, lest their efforts become self-defeating. Countries with
relatively strong fiscal and external positions, for example, should not adjust to the same extent as
countries facing market pressures. A successful resolution of the current crisis will thus require a
cohesive, comprehensive, and cooperative package of policies across the G-20.
15.
The focus is understandably on
Europe, but other G-20 countries must play
their part in supporting growth and
minimizing adverse spillovers. The call for
greater policy cohesion, cooperation, and
determination applies across the G-20.
16.
A successful resolution of the crisis
in Europe requires much more decisive
action on four fronts: fiscal sustainability;
stronger growth; an enhanced crisis
management
toolkit;
and
deepening
integration.
Decisive,
consistent,
and
predictive actions on these fronts would
improve consumer confidence and investor
sentiment.

Fiscal consolidation must continue
in many euro area economies, but it should
be structured and paced to avoid a collapse
in demand and growth. Sufficient near-term
fiscal adjustment is in train in most economies.
Countries should allow automatic stabilizers
operate freely, provided they can secure
funding for higher deficits; those facing very
low funding costs should consider a slower
pace of consolidation. Overdoing fiscal
adjustment in the short run to counter cyclical
revenue losses will undercut activity further,
diminish popular support for adjustment, and
further
undermine
market
confidence.
Countries with policy space might consider

slowing structural fiscal adjustment in 2012,
while maintaining their commitment to a
credible medium-term consolidation plan.
18.
The adverse effect of fiscal
consolidation on near-term growth should
be offset with other policies. This will require
a comprehensive and coordinated set of
policies in the following priority areas.


Bank recapitalization. Some deleveraging
is unavoidable, but the way it is achieved
matters—there is “good” and “bad
deleveraging. For example, if banks shed
legacy assets or sell non-core businesses
to strong institutions, it would not reduce
credit to the economy. However, credit to
the real economy is most affected when
banks curtail new loan originations and let
credit lines and loans run off. Countries,
working together with host supervisors
should monitor and limit deleveraging of
their banks at home and abroad. To limit
“bad”
deleveraging
and
avoid
a
devastating credit crunch, banks’ capital
buffers need to be replenished quickly.
This may require the use of public funds,
including the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) in economies under market
pressure. To sever the link between
escalating banking, sovereign, and growth
problems at the national level, supervisors

14
will need to do what is possible to avoid
excessively
fast
deleveraging.
For
countries under pressure, this may well
require recourse to euro-wide resources to
facilitate bank recapitalization.




Easier monetary policy. The adverse
feedback loops between low growth,
deteriorating public finances, and banking
sector stress could lead to a prolong
period of asset and consumer price
deflation. To forestall this adverse circuit,
the ECB’s monetary policy should be
highly accommodative, consistent with its
mandate of ensuring price stability. This
could be achieved by lower ECB monetary
policy interest rates, for which room exists,
and, as needed, further unconventional
measures.
Structural reforms. Fiscal consolidation
needs to go hand in hand with reforms to
entitlement programs and product and
labor markets. These policies will pay off in
the medium term by helping to address
underlying internal imbalances and
competitiveness problems, which are the
root causes of current travails. They can
also contribute in the short term, largely
by bolstering market confidence in the
prospects for growth.

19.
Deeper
fiscal
and
financial
integration over the medium term across
Europe will underpin the sustainability of
the common currency. But progress on these
objectives now would help avoid perceptions
of an incomplete response to current
challenges.


Policymakers must quickly implement the
“fiscal compact” agreed at the December
2011 EU summit.



Then policymakers should build on this
compact. In particular, fiscal rules should
be strengthened beyond current plans and
accompanied by a transparent and
credible framework of public finance risk
sharing.



Efforts should concentrate on addressing
the “weak tail” and repairing financial
institutions’ balance sheets. It is important
over the medium term to implement a
restructuring strategy that addresses
nonperforming assets and nonviable
banks. A companion to repairing balance
sheets should be improved disclosure of
prudential information; for example, EBA
should evolve to provide a consistent
regime for disclosure of problematic
assets.



Europe
must
move
towards
a
comprehensive
model
of
common
financial sector supervision and resolution,
with a common backstop and deposit
insurance. This will help build a stronger
euro-area financial system and break the
adverse feedback loops between banks
and sovereigns. In the meantime, more
effective resolution tools that facilitate the
orderly closing of cross-border banks are
required to restore financial stability.
Moving expeditiously on this reform
agenda, including adopting rules for
cross-border burden-sharing, requires a
high degree of political commitment.

20.
Giving these policies a chance to
exert their full effects will require deft
crisis management. Supplying sufficient
liquidity will help prevent abnormal funding
costs for banks and sovereigns and avoid
contagion. This is best done through official

15
sources, which could include expanded use of
the ECB’s balance sheet and additional real
resources for the EFSF and/or the European
Stability Mechanism (ESM). Countries and
institutions outside the euro area may usefully
contribute to this process. At the same time,
the ECB will need to continue providing
liquidity and stay fully engaged in securities
purchases to help improve the prospects for
financial stability.
21.
In other G-20 advanced economies,
there remains an urgent priority to set out
a credible path for fiscal consolidation over
the medium term. In the near term, sufficient
fiscal adjustment is planned in most advanced
economies. Automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate fully; in those economies
that can afford to do so, the pace of near-term
fiscal consolidation should slow. But mediumterm risks to the sustainability remain
unaddressed.




In the United States and Japan,
policymakers should redouble efforts to
formulate
and
implement
credible
medium-term
consolidation
plans.
Measures could include entitlement
reforms including new health care and
pension saving measures, caps on
discretionary spending, and tax system
reforms to boost fiscal revenue. Putting in
place such plans will also reinforce policy
room to support balance sheet repair,
growth, and job creation during this
period of heightened vulnerability.
In the United States, there is a risk that
political paralysis could lead to an
excessively rapid pace of deficit reduction,
including an early expiry of the existing
stimulus measures such as the payroll tax

cut. Such developments would further
undermine the already weak recovery.
22.
Monetary policies in other G-20
advanced economies should remain highly
accommodative. The Federal Reserve, Bank of
England, and Bank of Japan should stand
ready to continue or expand their deployment
of unconventional measures, if needed. In
particular, to ensure that the transmission
mechanism for monetary policy remains
effective, efforts should be directed at
devising targeted schemes that help ease
credit constraints on firms and households.
23.
In G-20 emerging economies, the
near-term focus should be on responding
to moderating domestic and slowing
external demand, while dealing with
volatile capital flows. As specific conditions
and available policy space vary widely across
these economies, the appropriate policy
response differs as well. But, in general,
inflation pressures have eased or are easing,
credit growth has peaked, and capital inflows
have diminished. Accordingly:


Monetary policies can be eased in
economies with diminishing inflationary
pressure but weaker fiscal fundamentals
(e.g., various economies in Latin America).
But this must be accompanied by macroprudential measures and enhanced
financial supervision where there are risks
of overheating in some sectors (such as
real estate).



Additional social spending to support
poorer households should be pursued in
economies where inflation is under
control, public debt is not high, and
external surpluses are large (e.g., China
and selected emerging economies in Asia).

16
In China, fiscal support could continue to
be provided to the economy by deferring
fiscal consolidation plans, lowering social
contributions and consumption taxes, and
increasing social transfers. This would also
be consistent with the authorities’
objective to rebalance the economy over
the medium term.


Policy space is more limited in those
economies that suffer from both relatively
high inflation and public debt. In these
cases,
including
India
and
some
economies in the Middle East, a more
cautious stance toward policy easing is
required.

24.
Collective
action
to
address
persistent global imbalances can better
guarantee that the global economy
overcomes its immediate challenges and
returns to strong, sustainable, and
balanced growth. Ensuring durable global
rebalancing
will
require
continued
deleveraging of households in advanced
deficit economies. In part, this would ensure
that the ongoing fiscal consolidation is not
fully offset by worsening of private sector
investment-saving balance. This process
should proceed together with sustained and
more inclusive growth and lower saving in
emerging surplus economies. The latter will
require alleviating distortions with financial
sector reform as well as enhanced pension,
healthcare,
and
education
systems,
complemented with less intervention in
foreign exchange markets.

ANNEX. PROGRESS AGAINST POLICY COMMITMENTS IN THE G-20 CANNES ACTION PLAN
This annex describes recent policy developments against the commitments made in the Cannes Action
Plan agreed in November 2011 for the seven countries selected by the Indicative Guidelines.
China
Exchange rate and financial sector reform:
 The exchange rate has been allowed to appreciate faster than in the past, with the real effective
exchange rate appreciating in annualized terms by over 19 percent during the 3 months to early
January 2012 (by over 8 percent during 2011). In addition, the pace of reserves accumulation has
slowed since Cannes.


The authorities need to continue to allow the exchange rate to appreciate closer to equilibrium
and to move ahead with financial sector reform—both of these elements are key ingredients in, if
not prerequisites to, the transformation of China’s economic growth model.

Structural and trade reform:
 Progress has been made in expanding social safety nets, allocating greater resources to pension,
healthcare, and education systems over recent years. The authorities recently implemented a
reduction in import tariffs. Factor inputs costs (electricity prices) have been raised and a pilot
program for a market-based pricing of natural gas has started.


Additional efforts are needed to reduce high saving and promote a sustained rebalancing of the
Chinese economy away from exports and investment towards private consumption. China now
relies more on domestic investment than prior to the crisis and it is questionable whether high
investment rates can be sustained.

France
Fiscal policies:
 The government announced fiscal measures for 2012-16 (later approved and somewhat
strengthened by Parliament) in order to keep the planned fiscal adjustment profile consistent with
the Toronto commitment. This medium term fiscal package includes all Cannes commitments,
except the introduction of fiscal rules in the constitution.


In principle, policies are well aligned, but projected outcomes rely on optimistic assumptions,
particularly with respect to economic growth over the 2012–16 period.

Structural reforms:
 Plans to increase competition in retail, energy, telecommunication and real estate have been
announced. A first draft of the reform was to be adopted by the Parliament before end 2011, but
has not yet been approved. The government has set out to increase the number of young people
on alternating work-study schemes from 600,000 now to 800,000 in 2015; additional incentives
will be provided to encourage the hiring of jobseekers aged over 45 on “professionalization”
contracts.

19
Germany
Fiscal policies:
 The recent fiscal consolidation plan announced by the German government and supported by the
national fiscal rule is in line with the Toronto commitment.
Structural and tax reforms:
 The government identified education and research and development, as well as innovation as
policy priority areas but the broad commitments for boosting productivity in the services sector,
in particular, would benefit from more specificity.


The government’s tax reform agenda is generally aligned with the objective of making tax regime
more employment friendly, but specific measures are still to be adopted.



The government announced a small tax cut (0.2 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014) as part of the
adjustment of income tax brackets for inflation. These changes are too small and too late to make
any material difference for the GDP growth in 2012, but they are moving in the direction of
Cannes commitments.

India
Structural reforms:
 The authorities have announced some piecemeal measures to boost infrastructure investment
(e.g., higher ceilings for foreign investment in infrastructure debt, relaxation of some maturity
requirements for foreign investment in debt, a readjustment of debt ceilings to encourage
secondary market trading).


Additional efforts are needed on energy pricing, regulatory streamlining, and improving the
overall business climate and governance. The authorities plan to introduce a Food Security Act
which will broaden access to subsidized food for a broad share of the population; Fund staff
supports this goal but no measures to improve targeting have been announced.

Japan


The pace of reconstruction spending has been slower than initially expected but is now underway.
Total reconstruction spending included in the earlier and FY2012 budgets amounts to about 4
percent of GDP spread across 2011 to 2013.



The government recently announced a proposal to raise the consumption tax rate from the
current level of 5 percent to 8 percent in 2014, and to 10 percent in late-2015, as part of a social
security and tax reform plan which will require Diet approval. Further details on a timeframe for
consumption tax increases beyond 2015 and reforms to entitlement spending are still needed.



In terms of measures to boost private domestic demand, the government has announced that
Japan would join negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) regional free trade
agreement. Beyond boosting exports, the TPP could revive domestic services through greater
market liberalization, deregulation, and inward foreign direct investment. More progress is also
needed in labor market reforms to raise participation by the young, elderly, and women.

20
United Kingdom
Monetary policy:
The Bank of England has undertaken appropriate measures to support price stability and recovery,
including the announcement of additional asset purchases (QE) in Fall 2011.
Fiscal policies:
 The U.K. has a credible fiscal consolidation plan and remains committed to putting the
government debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path by 2016. While due to recent downgrades to
the growth outlook, the authorities no longer project to halve the overall public-sector deficit
between 2011–14 (the deficit is forecast to fall only from 9.3 to 6.0 percent of GDP), they have
budgeted additional consolidation in 2015–17 to maintain their medium-term fiscal goals.


Fiscal consolidation includes growth-friendly measures—the main corporate tax was reduced from
28 percent to 26 percent and will be reduced gradually to 23 percent by 2014. Modest cuts in
spending with low multipliers have been announced (e.g., public employee wages) to fund higher
spending on items with high multipliers (infrastructure spending).



Plans have been announced to raise the pension age to 67 between 2026 and 2028 (previously,
the pension age was to rise to 67 between 2034 and 2036), to address long-term spending
pressures arising from changes in longevity.

United States
Fiscal policies:
 Certain expiring fiscal stimulus measures have been extended (a payroll tax cut, emergency
unemployment benefits) in support of the weak recovery. These extensions have so far been
legislated only for two months, but there is a bipartisan support in favor of a full-year 2012
extension pending an agreement on the budgetary offsets. The temporary extension of stimulus
has not added to long-term deficits since the measures were financed by a modest increase in the
Government Sponsored Enterprises mortgage loan guarantee fees, which should in turn
marginally increase incentives for a greater private sector participation in housing finance, in line
with the Cannes commitments.


The President’s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction unveiled in September meets
both the deficit and debt Toronto objectives, but under Fund staff’s baseline, further measures are
needed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability.



The Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to reach consensus on a
medium-term consolidation plan in November While the August Budget Control Act locks in a
$1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years through automatic spending cuts in lieu of the
agreement (in addition to the roughly $1 trillion in discretionary savings already legislated), more
progress is needed in the areas of revenue-raising measures and health and pension entitlements.
