EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Global activity has picked up, largely on account of advanced economies. Growth firmed in 2013H2, driven
largely by stronger outturns in advanced economies as final demand expanded broadly as expected. In many
emerging markets, despite a boost to output from stronger exports, domestic demand has been weaker than
expected, reflecting in part tighter financial conditions.
A new bout of financial volatility has affected emerging market economies as markets reassess their
fundamentals. While the pressures were relatively broad-based, emerging economies with relatively high inflation
and high current account deficits saw the largest asset price declines initially. Markets are showing signs of stabilizing
recently, although they are still fragile, on the back of actions by key emerging economies to shore up confidence and
strengthen their policy commitments. This episode, however, underscores vulnerabilities and the challenging
environment for many emerging economies. The rapid jump in global risk aversion had also driven down advanced
economy equity prices.
The outlook remains broadly as projected in the January WEO, assuming that the impact of the recent
financial volatility is short lived. In advanced economies, less fiscal consolidation and relaxed financial conditions
will support growth this year, while near-term prospects for emerging economies are broadly unchanged. Thus, global
growth is projected to increase to about 3¾ percent in 2014 (from 3 percent in 2013) and 4 percent in 2015, similar to
the January 2014 WEO Update.
However, the recovery is still weak and significant downside risks remain. Capital outflows, higher interest rates,
and sharp currency depreciation in emerging economies remain a key concern and a persistent tightening of financial
conditions could undercut investment and growth in some countries given corporate vulnerabilities. A new risk stems
from very low inflation in the euro area, where long-term inflation expectations might drift down, raising deflation
risks in the event of a serious adverse shock to activity.
Further action and cooperation are needed to promote financial stability and robust recovery. Specifically:


Advanced economies should avoid premature withdrawal of monetary accommodation as fiscal balances continue
consolidating. Given still large output gaps, very low inflation, and ongoing fiscal consolidation, monetary policy
should remain accommodative in advanced economies. There is scope for better cooperation on unwinding UMP,
including through wider central bank discussions of exit plans. In the euro area, repairing bank balance sheets
remains critical to monetary policy transmission. Finally, fiscal consolidation should proceed at a measured pace,
while preserving the long-run growth potential of the economy.



In emerging market economies, credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks, alongside exchange rate
flexibility, are critical to weather turbulence. Further monetary policy tightening in the context of strengthened
policy frameworks is necessary where inflation is still relatively high or where policy credibility has come into
question. Priority should also be given to shoring up fiscal policy credibility where it is lacking; subsequently
buffers should be built to provide space for counter-cyclical policy action. Exchange rate flexibility should
continue to facilitate external adjustment, particularly where currencies are overvalued, while FX intervention—
where reserves are adequate—can be used to smooth excessive volatility or prevent financial disruption.



Further policy actions are needed to reduce unemployment and strengthen medium-term growth, while making it
more balanced. Key policies to boost potential include competition-enhancing product market reforms,
infrastructure investment, and labor participation reforms, while further action is needed to avoid a resurgence of
global imbalances as the recovery proceeds and ensure sustainable medium-term growth.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
Global growth has strengthened as expected in recent months, largely driven by advanced
economies, where easier financial market conditions and gradually improving consumer and
business confidence have supported growth. While emerging economies have benefited from the
stronger external demand, domestic demand has remained weaker than expected in many of them,
reflecting in part tighter financial conditions. Many emerging markets have come under renewed
market pressure recently. While the trigger is difficult to identify, events are occurring against the
backdrop of weakening emerging economy sentiment, including on China, increased risk aversion,
and continued UMP tapering. While global growth is projected to continue increasing, the recovery
is uneven and fragile and significant downside risks remain.
1.
Global activity has picked up in recent months, largely on account of advanced
economies. Following a strong expansion in 2013Q2, global growth was 3.6 percent in the third
quarter. The recent uptick in growth has been concentrated in advanced economies, China, and
India. Final demand in advanced economies has expanded broadly as expected, and much of the
upward surprise in growth can be attributed to higher inventory demand. In emerging
economies, activity has been largely driven by exports, while domestic demand has generally
been weaker than expected as financial conditions tightened. Looking across regions:

appears solid, amidst strong contributions from

accumulation. Steady job creation and higher equity
and home prices are supporting consumption, while
non-residential investment continues to improve.
Other developments in the housing market have
been mixed, as higher mortgage rates feed into
weaker mortgage applications and pending home
sales.
The euro area is turning the corner from recession
to a weak recovery that remains uneven and
fragile. Growth resumed in the second quarter of
2013, and recent indicators suggest that activity
will continue to expand at a very modest pace.
Euro area growth has been largely export-led,
while domestic demand turned positive for the
first time since the recession for the area as a
whole as well as several major members. Germany
has continued to expand at a solid pace, output in
France has expanded by more than expected, and
Spain is tentatively exiting recession. However, the

recovery will remain fragile, as balance sheet repair and financial fragmentation continue
to weigh on economic activity notwithstanding stronger export performance. Despite a
modest revival of activity, inflation is currently well below the ECB’s medium-term price
stability target and has slowed further in recent months.


In Japan, growth remained firm in the second half of 2013—albeit with a moderation
from the early part of the year—supported in part by the front-loading of spending
ahead of the consumption tax hike in April. Inflation has begun to rise in recent months
and is becoming more broad-based. The economy, however, remains in a stimulus-driven
recovery with wages and private investment yet to rise decisively.



In emerging economies, stronger export growth has coincided with the slow-but-steady
acceleration of activity in advanced economies, providing a much-needed boost.
Domestic demand in many of these countries has remained weaker than expected,
reflecting to varying degrees tighter financial conditions and policy stances, as well as
policy or political uncertainty and bottlenecks. In China, with firming domestic demand in
the second half of the year, growth picked up and hit 7.7 percent for the year. India also
saw some increase in growth, as a result of a favorable monsoon season and higher
export growth. In Brazil activity weakened in the third quarter as investment growth
turned negative amid waning business confidence.

2.
A new bout of volatility in emerging economies has occurred against a confluence
of factors. Many emerging markets came under renewed financial pressure in the second half of
January—equities fell, spreads rose, and currencies of major economies depreciated. Markets
appear to be reassessing emerging market fundamentals as global conditions change. While the
pressures were relatively broad-based, countries with higher inflation and current account
deficits were amongst the most affected (Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and South Africa). The sell-off
came against the backdrop of several negative factors in some countries and weakening
sentiment toward emerging economies. Specifically, China’s shadow banking and weaker-thanexpected PMI data, continued or rising political tensions (Thailand, Turkey, South Africa, and
Ukraine), and Argentina’s depreciation all contributed to the negative sentiment against the
broader context of continued Fed tapering. Nonetheless, it is difficult to pinpoint a predominant

cause, as factors’ role may vary by country. While market sentiment recovered somewhat recently
as key emerging economies took steps to shore up confidence and strengthen their commitment
to policy objectives, this latest episode of financial market instability underscores the
vulnerabilities of EMs. In advanced economies, financial conditions have eased since the release of
the October 2013 WEO, despite significant recent falls in equity markets on the back of the rapid
jump in global risk aversion. Long-term bond yields are generally lower than the post-taper highs
and risk premia on government debt of crisis-hit euro area economies have declined noticeably.
However, financial fragmentation persists in the euro area and private sector credit is still
contracting.

3.
The outlook is for a further strengthening in the recovery, broadly as projected in
the January WEO, assuming the impact of recent volatility is short-lived. In advanced
economies, the 2014 stimulus package offsetting the drag from the consumption tax increase in
Japan, less fiscal consolidation in the United States and the euro area, as well as easing financial
conditions will support growth. In emerging economies, growth in China is expected to moderate
slightly in 2014–15, in part because of policy measures aimed at slowing credit growth and
raising the cost of capital. In India, growth should firm up further, thanks to project approvals by
the Cabinet Committee on Investment. Elsewhere, growth remains sluggish on account of weak
domestic demand, including in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa, although in most cases
it is still expected to increase this year and next. For some economies, notably those who raised
policy rates given market pressure, growth is likely to be revised downward. However, the global
outlook is broadly as in the January WEO Update, with global growth projected to increase from
3 percent in 2013 to about 3.7 percent in 2014 and 4 percent in 2015.
4.
The recovery is still fragile, and significant downside risks (old and new) remain. In
emerging economies, increased financial market and capital flow volatility remains a key concern
as the Federal Reserve continues unwinding unconventional monetary policy measures and
market conditions start to normalize. Concerns about the withdrawal from UMP in the United
States have already provoked sharp price movements in emerging markets. Market normalization
will lead to portfolio reallocation and capital outflows in emerging economies, with risks for
lower investment and potentially financial disruptions, notably in those with domestic
weaknesses. Vulnerabilities related to built-up positions, including a substantial increase in
foreign holdings of domestic sovereign bonds and higher leverage, both in the form of more
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

direct FX borrowing by corporations and a rapid increase in domestic credit, could amplify the
impact of shocks. A new risk to activity stems from very low inflation in advanced economies,
especially the euro area, which, if below target for an extended period, could de-anchor longerterm inflation expectations. Low inflation raises the likelihood of a deflation in case of a serious
adverse shock to activity. In the euro area, low inflation also complicates the task in the periphery
where the real burden of both public and private debt would rise as real interest rates increased.

POLICIES FOR A SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY
Monetary policy should remain accommodative in advanced economies, as output gaps are large
and fiscal consolidation will continue. Emerging economies need to rebuild policy space and in
some cases address domestic imbalances and vulnerabilities to prepare for tighter financial
conditions. Further actions, including structural reforms, and cooperation are needed across the
membership to lay the foundations for stronger and more balanced medium-term growth.
Advanced Economies
5.
Monetary policy should continue supporting demand given the still-large output
gaps and ongoing fiscal consolidation. With prospects improving, it will be critical to avoid a
premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation, including in the United States. There
is scope for better cooperation on unwinding UMP, especially through wider central bank
discussions of exit plans.


In the United States, continued asset purchases over the next several months, albeit at a
lower rate, and strengthened Fed forward guidance on interest rates should help keep
expected short-term rates low for some time, and moderate the pace of any increases in
long-term rates. Looking forward, the Fed will need to gradually adjust the pace and
composition of asset purchases to reflect evolving economic conditions, while continuing
its careful policy communication to mitigate the risk of excessive market volatility.



In the euro area, more monetary easing is needed to raise the prospects of achieving the
ECB’s inflation objective, including by supporting demand, given the weak and fragile
growth, large output gaps and very low inflation. Further actions could include longerterm LTROs (possibly targeted to SMEs), and further rate cuts, including mildly negative
deposit rates, to support demand and reduce fragmentation. But it would be critical to

sufficient national backstops, while the establishment of a common backstop (ESM direct
recapitalization) remains crucial to sever sovereign-bank links in countries where debt
dynamics are a concern and fiscal space is limited. Completing the banking union is also
critical to reducing financial fragmentation. In particular, a Single Resolution Mechanism
(SRM) based on an independent centralized authority, with efficient resolution powers—
supported by a single resolution fund—would be necessary to ensure least cost and
timely resolution. The recent Council agreement on the SRM is a step forward but the
process appears complex, and may cause delays in decision making. A quicker transition
period for the mutualization of national contributions to the single resolution fund and a
clearer decision on a common backstop and its timing are required to adequately break
sovereign-bank links.


In Japan, much has been done by the BoJ. Inflation and inflation expectations have
picked up, and there does not appear to be a need for further easing at the moment.
However, should it become clear that progress toward the 2 percent inflation target has
reversed or stalled, the BoJ should ease further, together with action the other two
arrows of Abenomics, structural reform (to boost investment, employment, and
productivity) and fiscal consolidation.

6.
Fiscal consolidation should continue at a gradual pace, while preserving the longterm growth potential of the economy. While debt ratios should start declining from 2015
onward, fiscal deficits remain high relative to pre-crisis levels and there is still some way to go to
rebuild policy buffers and bring debt ratios to prudent levels. Fiscal consolidation should
continue at a gradual pace, within the framework of concrete medium-term plans (notably in
Japan and the United States). At the same time, past fiscal consolidation has been heavily
focused on tax increases and wage and public investment cuts, exacerbating the trend decline in
public capital stocks. Going forward, the design of fiscal policy should be careful to support the
long-run growth potential of the economies, including by enhancing infrastructure investment,
which will also boost demand. Consolidation should rely on a more balanced distribution of
spending cuts, where revenue ratios are already high; where there is scope to raise revenues, the
emphasis should be on broadening the tax base. Specifically:



In the United States, the December 2013 budget agreement was an encouraging example
of bipartisanship and provided partial relief from the sequester. However, it remains
essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy, by raising the
debt limit in a more durable manner and adopting a balanced and comprehensive
medium-term fiscal plan (including entitlement and tax reforms) that puts public debt on
a downward path.



In Japan, the decision to implement the first phase of the consumption tax increase sent
a strong signal about the government’s resolve to tackle the country’s fiscal imbalances.
However, much more is needed to put the debt ratio on a downward path; the recent
fiscal stimulus package increased the urgency of a concrete medium-term consolidation
plan. The implementation of the second stage of consumption tax rate increase in 2015 is
of great importance, and should go ahead. If, however, growth slows considerably, fiscal
measures could be considered in the context of a credible consolidation strategy.



In the euro area, the overall fiscal stance planned for 2014 is neutral, although a number
of countries are still tightening, even if at a slower pace. This is broadly appropriate.
However, if low growth persists and monetary policy options are depleted, the flexibility
in the current fiscal framework may need to be used to respond in these circumstances.
Further progress is also needed in improving national fiscal governance in the context of
recent fiscal institutions reforms in the euro area.

Emerging Economies
7.
Credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks, alongside exchange rate
flexibility are needed to weather the turbulence. Emerging economies face both near-term
and medium-term challenges to support growth. In the near term, priorities include:
(i) weathering the current turbulence and capital outflows and (ii) choosing counter-cyclical
policy to close output gaps where possible, or the unavoidable pro-cyclical policies for those
lacking policy space/credibility. The strengthening of the recovery and unwinding of
accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies will lead to tighter external financing
conditions and could generate further bouts of volatility in capital flows. As recent turbulences
have shown, economies with deteriorating macroeconomic imbalances, larger external funding
requirements (relative to reserves) and lower policy credibility see more volatility. And when risk
sentiment changes against EMs indiscriminately, having the policy space and credibility to react
has been critical. Policy priorities are thus for a coherent macroeconomic policy mix with a
credible nominal anchor and good communication. Specifically:


On the fiscal front, emerging market economies need to ensure policy credibility,
subsequently buffers should be built to provide space for counter-cyclical policy action.
The urgency for action varies across economies and is especially high in economies with
large deficits, high debt levels and/or more sensitive to increases in U.S. rates. Some
countries (Brazil and China) also need to reduce quasi-fiscal activity, which has increased
contingent risks to public finances, and improve the transparency of these operations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7





On the monetary front, economies where inflation
is still relatively high, or where policy credibility
has come into question, need to continue
tightening monetary policy in the context of
strengthened policy frameworks (India and
Turkey).
Exchange rates should be allowed to adjust in
response to changing fundamentals. In several
emerging economies, the depreciation of the real
exchange rate is helping correct the currency
misalignment and should contribute to reduce
the relatively large current account deficits.
However, when the ability to depreciate is
constrained by balance sheet mismatches and
other financial fragilities and the risk of igniting
inflation, policymakers might need to consider
tightening macroeconomic policies. At the same
time, where very rapid flows lead to financial
market disruption and sound macroeconomic
policies fail to stabilize the tensions, liquidity
provision and exchange market interventions,
where reserves are adequate, can be used to
smooth excessive volatility or prevent financial
disruption.

Macro-prudential and financial stability measures also have an important role to play.
There is a need to strengthen capital and provisioning requirements to provide greater
buffers in sudden stop or slow-growth scenarios; ensure that banks address credit quality
and profitability problems, which may result from previous rapid credit growth or lower
capital inflows; contain and monitor foreign exchange and credit exposures; and finally,
control the growth of inadequately regulated shadow banking activities, and overall
credit growth rates where these do not appear to be sustainable.

Rebalancing and Structural reforms
8.
Further action across the membership and cooperation are needed to promote
financial stability and ensure sustainable medium-term growth. Progress on global
rebalancing and making growth more sustainable has been mixed. External imbalances have
declined appreciably since the crisis. This reflects in part healthy adjustments but weaker demand
in advanced deficit economies has played a substantial role. Accordingly, in a number of surplus
countries, further reforms are needed to boost domestic demand or modify its composition. In
China, the desired rebalancing toward consumption can be achieved through steadfast
implementation of the recently announced reform blueprint, especially through improving
financial intermediation, allowing more flexibility in the exchange rate by reducing intervention

over time, and strengthening the social safety net. Germany needs to boost investment, both
public infrastructure and private investment, through tax and financial system reform and
services sector liberalization. In a number of deficit economies, structural reform is needed to
improve competitiveness (France, Italy, South Africa, Spain, and U.K.) and remove supply
bottlenecks to strengthen exports (India and South Africa).
9.
Product and labor market reforms are also needed across the membership to lay
the foundations for stronger medium-term growth. The crisis has caused important losses in
productivity, employment, and investment relative to longer-term trends, especially in advanced
economies (see Annex). While these partly reflect still large output gaps, potential output also
got hit. At the same time, key emerging economies (Brazil, India, and China), which were a main
engine of global growth in recent years, are experiencing slower potential growth, despite still
large catch-up needs. In Brazil and India, the slowdown reflects infrastructure and regulatory
bottlenecks, while in China it is due to excess capacity created by the credit and investment
boom. Most members have considerable scope to improve the functioning of product markets.
In surplus economies (China, Germany, Japan, and Korea), action should be mostly focused on
liberalizing domestic services and other non-tradable sectors, though in Japan agriculture also
needs liberalization. In deficit countries, reforms are generally needed in both tradable and nontradable sectors. Many emerging economies also have scope to improve the business
environment. Labor market reforms, especially to raise participation by women and/or older
workers, are important in many members, but especially in advanced economies undergoing
population aging (Germany, Japan, and Korea) or where an important fraction of the population
remains underemployed. Finally, infrastructure needs are high in emerging economies, especially
those that are experiencing supply bottlenecks (e.g. Brazil, India), while some advanced
economies would benefit from a modernization of their infrastructure (e.g. Germany, the United
States).
10.
Strengthened and cooperative policy actions have substantial gains in terms of
lowering financial risks and increasing growth (Annex). Scenario simulations suggest that
reforms would raise world growth by about 0.5 percentage point per year over the next five years
(boosting global output by about 2¼ trillion dollars). Product market reforms have the largest
growth pay-off, followed by labor participation reforms and infrastructure investment. While the
gains stem mostly from policies that countries need to implement for their own good, joint
action could produce beneficial growth spillovers in the longer term. Even more importantly,
joint action can reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing
external imbalances and the associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence.

SUMMARY
The recovery has been disappointing, with G-20 output still below longer-term trend. Output
losses have been especially large in advanced deficit economies, and reflect both cyclical and
structural factors. They can be decomposed into losses in productivity, investment, and employment.
External imbalances have narrowed alongside weak demand and hence lower imports in deficit
countries, while adjustments toward desirable policies have been modest.
Joint action is needed to boost output and to lower global risks substantially through more
balanced growth. As the output losses reflect both lower potential growth and the output gap,
demand and supply measures are needed. But as output gaps close, external imbalances may increase
again, implying that further action on internal and external rebalancing is also required to ensure the
sustainability of medium-term growth. Policies should aim at three goals: bringing output back to
potential; raising potential; and rebalancing growth.
 Bringing output back to potential. Monetary policy should remain accommodative in advanced
economies given the still large output gaps and the ongoing fiscal consolidation. In emerging
economies, credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks, alongside exchange rate flexibility,
are critical to weather turbulences in a context of tighter external financing conditions. There is
also scope for better cooperation on unwinding UMP, especially through wider central bank
discussions of exit plans.
 Raising potential. Strengthening medium-term growth requires action on structural policy gaps,
including product market reforms, labor market reforms, and in some economies, infrastructure
investment. Most members have considerable scope to improve the functioning of product
markets. Some members also need to make their labor markets more job-friendly, while many can
boost employment and output by removing disincentives to participation in the labor market for
women, older workers, and youth. Finally, infrastructure needs are high in emerging markets,
especially those experiencing supply bottlenecks, while some advanced economies would benefit
from a modernization of their infrastructure.
 Rebalancing growth. Further action and cooperation are needed to avoid a resurgence of global
imbalances as the recovery proceeds and ensure sustainable medium-term growth. In a number
of surplus countries, reforms are needed to boost domestic demand or rebalance demand from
investment to consumption. In a number of deficit countries, reforms should boost
competitiveness and remove supply bottlenecks to strengthen exports.
Strengthened and cooperative policies would deliver stronger, more balanced, and sustainable
medium-term growth while reducing risks of renewed global turmoil. Simulations of a plausible
reform scenario suggest that desirable product and labor market reforms, together with rebalancing
policies in key external deficit and surplus economies would raise world output by 2¼ trillion dollars
by 2018 (about 0.5 percentage point higher growth per year), while reducing substantially global
imbalances and lowering public debt ratios. While most of the gains are attributable to domestic
policies, joint action could produce beneficial growth spillovers in the medium to long term. Even
more importantly, joint action can also reduce risks of renewed global turmoil both by reducing
external imbalances and internal distortions and by strengthening market confidence.

RECOVERY FROM THE GREAT RECESSION: STOCKTAKING
The recovery has been disappointingly weak, with G-20 output still far below longer-term trend,
reflecting both cyclical and structural factors, and large output losses, notably in advanced deficit
economies. At the same time, progress on internal and external rebalancing has been limited.
1.
The recovery from the Great Recession has been disappointing, with G-20 output
still below longer-term trend. Global activity strengthened during the second half of 2013 on
account of firming activity in advanced economies, and global output growth is projected to
increase from 3 percent in 2013 to around 3¾ percent in 2014 and 4 percent in 2015. However,
five years since the Great Recession, output remains far below the longer-term trend level,
especially in advanced economies.1 In 2013, (per capita) output losses relative to trend amounted
to 8 percent for the G-20 as a whole, with a higher loss in advanced deficit economies (11
percent). Trade volumes (real exports and imports) remain well below trends as well. Notably, the
recovery has also been much slower than was anticipated in the wake of the crisis: the G-20’s
2013 real GDP level was 2 percent below the downside scenario projection prepared for the 2010
Mutual Assessment Process. The strong growth projected in 2010 was based on an expected
rapid decline in unemployment, accompanied by a strong crowd-in of private demand, which did
not materialize.

Below trend output levels across the G-20 reflect both cyclical and structural
factors. Output gaps remain significantly negative in advanced deficit countries, suggesting that
the demand shortfall is the binding constraint to growth in the short-term. However, potential
output was also damaged following the Great Recession in many economies. Importantly, going
forward, the WEO baseline projections for the medium term suggest permanent crisis-related
output losses for the G-20 as a whole, driven by large losses for advanced economies where
potential growth is envisaged to remain generally weak. At the same time, potential growth in

emerging surplus economies, which have been a major engine of world growth in the recent
past, is expected to decline (as reflected in growing output losses relative to longer-term trend).
This slowdown likely reflects various factors, some of which may be desirable, including policy
efforts in China to steer demand away from investment and towards consumption underpinned
by the reform blueprint.
3.
Output losses can be decomposed into losses in investment, productivity, and
employment. To better understand the sources of these losses, actual per capita output and its
(demand and supply) components are compared with the level they would have reached had
they followed their longer-term trend.
G-20: Supply Side Decomposition 1/


A demand-side decomposition of output losses shows
that investment in the G-20 remains well below longerterm trend, by 18 percent. The losses are especially large
for advanced deficit economies but also significant in
advanced surplus and emerging deficit economies. For
the G-20 as a whole, consumption is only mildly below
trend; however, this masks regional variation, with
consumption depressed in advanced deficit economies
and above trend in emerging economies.

Slower productivity growth and capital accumulation undermine long term growth
prospects. While they may partly reflect the weak demand after the global financial crisis,
measured TFP losses (relative to trend) are significant and projected to be persistent in the
medium term. One could argue that the pre-crisis boom and productivity hike were not
sustainable and that the underlying output gaps and TFP losses are smaller than currently
estimated. But calculating the trend over a longer period yields similar TFP losses. These losses
suggest that the scarring effect of the crisis (for instance difficult-to-reverse misallocation of
capital over pre-crisis booms, reductions in research and development spending) may have
dominated its cleansing effect (the fact that the least productive firms are forced first out of
business). The slowdown in capital accumulation will also affect potential growth negatively. In
contrast, labor inputs have been relatively resilient—with the exception of advanced deficit
economies—and they are projected to return to their trend in the medium term.
5.
The narrowing of external imbalances has occurred alongside compressed demand
in advanced deficit economies. External imbalances have declined appreciably since the crisis
reflecting in part healthy adjustments, such as a rebound in low private saving and, more
recently, improvements in fiscal balances in external-deficit economies and resilient domestic
demand in key emerging surplus economies. However, a sizable part of the narrowing of
imbalances also reflects weaker demand in advanced deficit economies, while adjustments
toward desirable policies over the medium term have been modest in general and played only a
small role in reducing global imbalances so far. Against this background, there remains a risk that
global imbalances may re-emerge when advanced deficit economies close their output gaps,
especially if desirable policy adjustments are not taken.3 On the fiscal front, despite sizable
consolidation efforts, imbalances remain large in advanced economies, partly on account of slow
growth. Fiscal deficits are still above their pre-crisis levels, and public debt is projected to
stabilize only at very high levels—too high to rebuild needed policy space or to deal with future
challenges such as aging.

POLICIES FOR GROWTH AND REBALANCING
For a successful recovery, advanced economies should continue supporting their still weak demand,
while emerging economies should prepare for tighter external financing conditions. Bringing output
back to potential though is unlikely to be enough to deliver a robust recovery. In both advanced
and emerging economies, structural reforms are also needed to lay the foundations for stronger
medium-term growth. Moreover, further progress on internal and external rebalancing is needed in
surplus and deficit economies to ensure sustainable medium-term growth. The beneficial spillovers
from joint action could be sizable.
6.
Joint action is needed to achieve the G-20 shared objectives of strong, sustainable
and balanced growth. Policies should aim at three goals: getting output back to potential;
increasing potential; and further rebalancing growth, focusing on external demand in deficit
countries and internal demand in surplus countries. The relative weights on these three
objectives should depend on the relative contributions of output gaps and weaker potential to
output losses. If (current and projected) output losses largely reflect weaker potential, then
policies should focus on increasing potential output, and the need for rebalancing policies may
be less—as the observed narrowing of imbalances would be more durable. In contrast, if the
output gap is larger, then getting output back to potential while further rebalancing growth
should be a priority. While there is an inherent uncertainty in estimating output gaps (as
potential output is unobservable), the above analysis suggests that output losses reflect both
large output gaps and weaker potential.

Bringing Output Back to Potential
7.
Monetary policy should continue supporting demand in advanced economies in
view of the still large output gaps and ongoing fiscal consolidation. With prospects
improving, it will be critical to avoid a premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation,
including in the United States. In the euro area, more monetary easing is needed to raise the
prospects of achieving the ECB’s inflation objective, complemented with further repair of banks’
balance sheets and efforts to complete the banking union. In Japan, the BoJ should watch
carefully for risks of a loss of momentum in inflation expectations. Should it become clear that
progress toward the 2 percent inflation target has reversed or stalled, the BoJ should ease
further, together with action on the other two arrows of Abenomics, structural reform to boost
investment, employment, and productivity, and strong medium-term fiscal consolidation plans.
Fiscal consolidation is still needed in most countries but should remain gradual and anchored in
credible and concrete medium-term plans (see below). Consolidation should rely on a more
balanced distribution of spending cuts and tax revenues, where revenue ratios are already high;
where there is scope to raise revenues, the emphasis should be on broadening the tax base.
8.
Meanwhile, in emerging economies, credible macroeconomic policies and
frameworks, alongside exchange rate flexibility, are needed to weather the turbulence. The
strengthening of the recovery and future unwinding of accommodative monetary policy in
advanced economies will result in tighter external financial conditions, lower capital inflows, and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

possibly further bouts of volatility in capital flows for emerging economies. In economies where
inflation is still relatively high, or where policy credibility has come into question, further
monetary policy tightening in the context of strengthened policy frameworks is necessary. On
the fiscal front, emerging economies need to ensure policy credibility; subsequently buffers
should be built to provide space for counter-cyclical policy action. Exchange rate flexibility
should continue to facilitate external adjustment, particularly where currencies are overvalued,
with FX intervention—for countries with adequate reserves—targeted to smooth excessive
exchange rate volatility or prevent financial disruption. Finally, prudential policies should ensure
that financial institutions address credit quality and profitability problems, which may have
resulted from the recent rapid credit growth or lower capital inflows, while containing excessive
leverage and foreign exposure.

Laying the Ground for Stronger and More Balanced Medium-term Growth
9.
Gradual fiscal consolidation should proceed in the medium term, while better
supporting long-run growth. It should be anchored in concrete and credible medium-term
plans, which are notably lacking in the United States and Japan. Moreover, past fiscal
consolidation in advanced economies has been heavily focused on wage cuts and public
investment, exacerbating the trend decline in public capital stocks. Going forward, the design of
fiscal policy should be careful to support the long-run growth potential of these economies,
including by enhancing infrastructure investment, which will also boost demand. In India, there is
a need for sustainable fiscal consolidation and reorientation of spending toward investment and
social sectors, requiring subsidy reform and an overhaul of taxation. In Brazil, strengthening the
fiscal framework to rebuild fiscal buffers and bolster confidence would entail adherence to a
primary balance that puts gross debt firmly on a downward path and more fully recognizing
contingent fiscal risks.
10.
Further action and cooperation are needed to avoid a resurgence of global
imbalances as the recovery proceeds and ensure sustainable medium-term growth. Making
growth more balanced and sustainable requires boosting internal demand in surplus countries
and shifting from internal to external demand in deficit countries. In a number of surplus
countries, reforms are needed to increase domestic demand or modify its composition.
Specifically, in China, steadfast implementation of the recently announced reform blueprint is
required to achieve desired rebalancing toward consumption through (i) improving financial
intermediation; (ii) strengthening social safety nets; (iii) fostering competition by opening up the
services sector and leveling the playing fields; and (iv) allowing more flexibility in the exchange
rate by reducing intervention over time. In Germany, policy should focus on boosting domestic
demand, especially investment, through tax and financial system reform, but also services sector
liberalization and higher public investment (see below). In a number of deficit economies,
structural reform is needed to improve external competitiveness (France, Italy, South Africa,
Spain, and U.K.) and remove supply bottlenecks to strengthen exports (India and South Africa). In
some cases (e.g. China), the implementation of rebalancing reforms could somewhat slow nearterm growth, but they are vital in containing vulnerabilities and achieving sustainable growth. In

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

other cases, structural reforms can contribute to both rebalancing and stronger growth (see
below).
11.
Structural reforms can boost medium-term growth substantially, though with
uncertain impact on rebalancing. Country desks’ assessments suggest policy gaps in three
main areas which, if addressed, have the potential to boost medium-term growth and
employment: product markets, labor market reforms, and in some cases infrastructure
investment. These policies can boost growth by addressing the gaps in productivity,
employment, and investment identified above. Action on one gap may also help close the others:
for instance, increases in productivity will likely lead to increased investment and employment,
while higher employment will require additional capital accumulation to accommodate the new
workers. The specific reform priorities are as follows:


Product market reforms can boost productivity by increasing competition and/or
improving the business environment. Most members have scope to improve the
functioning of product markets. In surplus countries where productivity has been
concentrated in the tradable sector (China, Germany, Japan, and Korea), the focus of
reforms should be on strengthening productivity in domestic services and other nontradable sectors to generate more balanced growth, though in Japan agriculture also
needs liberalization. In deficit countries, improvements are generally needed in both
tradable and non-tradable sectors.



Labor market reforms can also boost output substantially by increasing employment.
Some countries (France, South Africa, and Spain) need to make their labor market
institutions more job-friendly to lower a high natural rate of unemployment and improve
competitiveness. Reforms to remove disincentives to female and older workers’
participation in the labor market are needed to maintain or increase labor supply in
advanced countries undergoing population aging (especially Germany, Japan, and Korea)
or where an important fraction of the population remains underemployed.



Finally, infrastructure investment can boost medium-term growth by increasing private
investment productivity. Infrastructure investment needs are high in emerging
economies, especially those that are experiencing supply bottlenecks (e.g. Brazil, India),
while infrastructure modernization would also boost growth in some advanced
economies (e.g. Germany and the U.S.). Quality of infrastructure investment is key to
ensure that resources are used effectively and boost the productivity of private
investment. Countries could also foster higher involvement of the private sector in the
provision of infrastructure services, including through PPPs, although this would also
often call for a strengthening of the related regulatory and transparency framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

12.
Model simulations suggest that the above reforms would deliver stronger mediumterm growth. A plausible reform scenario is simulated with the IMF Research Department G-20
model to illustrate the medium-term impact of these policy actions on the shared growth
objectives.4 The model is calibrated using the 2012 OECD estimates of the impact of product and
labor market reforms on productivity and employment. The specific policy assumptions for each
country are based on IMF desks’ assessments of policy gaps across six reform areas—fiscal,
rebalancing, labor supply, other labor market reforms, product market reforms, and infrastructure
investment (see Box 1), which are used to scale the OECD estimates for the impact of reforms.
The policies assumed in the scenario raise world real GDP by about 2¼ percent (or 2¼ trillion
U.S. dollars) in 2018 (relative to the October 2013 WEO baseline), implying 0.5 percentage point
higher growth over the next five years. Such gains would be sustained over a longer horizon until
all the effects of the reforms have played out. World output gains stem largely from productivity
increases, with substantial contributions from higher employment and capital accumulation.5
Product market reforms contribute the most to the higher growth, followed by labor
participation reforms and infrastructure investment.

needed to reduce risks to the sustainability of growth arising from domestic and external

While the gains stem mostly from policies that countries need to implement for

The reform scenario suggests that most of the gains stem from policies that are beneficial from

Even more importantly, cooperative action can reduce the risk of renewed global
turmoil. Cooperative policies that raise growth, reduce global external imbalances and the
internal distortions that give rise to them, would improve market confidence and reduce risks.
Demonstrated commitment to these joint actions would send a strong signal to market
participants about the importance that global policymakers attach to the objective of reducing
global risks through policy cooperation.

Productivity spillovers are higher for countries closer to the technological frontier which moves further out

Box 1. Policy Assumptions for the Reform Scenario
The reform scenario consists of six layers: (i) fiscal consolidation over the medium term;
(ii) rebalancing reforms in China, Germany, and the United States; (iii) product market reforms;
(iv) labor participation reforms; (v) other labor market reforms; and (vi) infrastructure investment.
Specifically:
Fiscal Reforms. Fiscal consolidation is based on the country desks’ estimate of the gap between
the 2013 cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance and the desirable future fiscal balance. An attempt is
made to ensure consistency with the desirable fiscal balances underlying the External Balance
Assessment and the External Sector Report, though these numbers are still subject to revisions.
The fiscal consolidation is phased in progressively over 5 years, except for Japan where it is
phased in over 10 years.
Rebalancing Reforms. In China, additional reforms to education, healthcare, and pensions raise
public transfers by 1.1 percent of GDP and reduce private savings by 1 percent of GDP over
5 years. Financial sector reforms help better pricing of risks, raising the cost of capital to tradable
sector firms by 50 basis points after 5 years. The financial sector reforms also result in a shift to
higher quality investment, implying a reduction in the private capital depreciation rate of 50 basis
points after 5 years. These policies are accompanied by a fully flexible exchange rate. In Germany,
reforms are implemented to increase economy-wide productivity by 1 percent after 5 years. In
the United States, reforms encourage an increase in private saving by about ½ percent of GDP
after 5 years.
Labor and Product Market Reforms. Three types of structural reforms are considered: product
market reforms, labor participation reforms and job-friendly labor market reforms. Product
market reforms (PMR) and labor market reforms to ease overly restrictive employment protection
legislation (EPL) boost productivity. Reforms that increase the labor force participation rate
include increases in childcare spending (CHILDC) and pension reforms (PENTOT). Finally, other
labor market policies cover active labor market policies (ALMP) and in some cases reductions in
unemployment benefit average replacement rates (ARR). The magnitude of reforms is based on
OECD inputs and scaled by IMF country desk priorities. For instance, PMR reform is defined as a
20 per cent reduction in the degree of regulation in services industries, based on the average
decline observed in OECD countries that have made reforms over the past 10 years. Similarly, EPL
reform corresponds to a 20 per cent reduction in the strictness of employment protection
legislation based on the magnitude of observed reforms in OECD countries over the past 10
years. If the reform is ranked as first priority by desks, the full OECD shock is implemented. For
second priority reforms, 75% of the OECD shock is implemented, and if the reform is ranked as
low priority, 50% of the OECD shock is implemented. Product market reforms are phased in
gradually and the productivity shocks become fully credible in 2018 (see Table 1 below for
impact in 2018).
Infrastructure Investment. The reform scenario includes a permanent increase in public
investment of ½ percentage point of baseline GDP in the United States, Germany, Brazil, India,
