EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery suffered a setback and despite recent improvements remains subject to major downside
risks. Global activity will slow in 2012. The euro area is still expected to enter a mild recession, and other advanced
economies are likely to experience weak and bumpy growth. In emerging economies, growth is expected to continue
moderating, reflecting past policy tightening and adverse spillovers from advanced economies.
Risks to global growth remain squarely to the downside, although recent policies and financial market
developments have lowered the probability of a sharp global slowdown. The overarching risk remains an
intensified global “paradox of thrift” as households, firms, and governments around the world reduce demand. This
risk is further exacerbated by fragile financial systems, high public deficits and debt, and already-low interest rates,
making the current environment fertile ground for multiple equilibria—self-perpetuating outcomes resulting from
pessimism or optimism, notably in the euro area. Other key risks include hard landings in emerging economies and
sharply higher oil prices, driven by geopolitical-related supply concerns.
The euro area must build on recent measures and act decisively on multiple fronts to achieve a successful
resolution to the crisis. Fiscal consolidation should be structured to avoid a decline in demand, and countries with
fiscal space should reconsider the pace of near-term adjustment. Euro area members benefiting from financial
assistance programs should stick to the agreed consolidation efforts. The adverse effects of fiscal consolidation on
growth should be mitigated by other policies: easier monetary policy; bank recapitalization to support credit; and
structural and institutional reforms to address the root causes of the crisis. Deft crisis management is required. The
ECB’s 3 year LTRO has improved market sentiment, relieving pressures on euro area banks and sovereigns. Sufficient
liquidity should be provided, by expanding the ECB’s balance sheet and augmenting resources for the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Importantly, to underpin the
sustainability of the common currency deeper financial and fiscal integration over the medium term is required.
In other advanced economies, there remains an urgent need to set out a credible path for fiscal consolidation
over the medium term. Sufficient adjustment is planned in most advanced economies in the near term. If downside
risks to growth materialize, countries with fiscal space should allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully. Countries
that can afford it may consider slowing fiscal adjustment in 2012, while maintaining their commitment to a credible
medium-term consolidation plan. Monetary policy should remain highly accommodative—through unconventional
measures, if necessary.
In emerging economies, the priority is to ensure a soft landing as domestic growth slows amid a deteriorating
external environment and volatile capital flows. Monetary policies can be eased in economies with diminishing
inflationary pressure (e.g., Latin America) and, where necessary, should be complemented with macro-prudential
measures and enhanced financial supervision to insure against overheating in some sectors (e.g., real estate). There is
scope to increase expenditure—including, in some cases, social spending—in economies where inflation pressure is
expected to ease, fiscal positions are sound, and external surpluses are large (e.g., China). In those economies with
relatively high inflation and public debt, policy space is more limited, warranting a more cautious stance toward policy
easing (e.g., India).
Collective action to address global imbalances can help ensure a return to strong, sustainable, and balanced
growth. This will require further deleveraging by households in advanced deficit economies, and policies encouraging
more inclusive growth and lower saving in emerging surplus economies—through financial sector reform, enhanced
pension, healthcare, and education policies, and less intervention in foreign exchange markets.

I. GLOBAL CONJUNCTURE
Despite some recent positive developments, the global recovery continues to be threatened by
strains in the euro area and fragilities elsewhere. Market perceptions have improved recently owing
to progress in addressing the euro area crisis and easing concerns about vulnerabilities in other
countries. Risks, however, remain squarely to the downside. The euro area economy has begun to
contract and the threat of intensified sovereign-financial feedback loops and financial sector
deleveraging continues to cast a shadow over the outlook. Other advanced economies are
experiencing weak and bumpy growth, reflecting both the legacies from the crisis and spillovers
from Europe. Meanwhile, emerging economies have slowed by more than expected, reflecting partly
the effects of past policy tightening.

1.
Global activity has slowed. Activity
remained relatively robust in the third
quarter of 2011, with global GDP expanding
at an annualized rate of 3½ percent. During
this period, growth in advanced economies
surprised on the upside, as consumers in the
United States unexpectedly lowered their
saving rates and business fixed investment
showed strength, and consumption was
supported by stabilizing oil prices. However,
in the final quarter of 2011, amid a sharp
tightening
of
financial
conditions,
developments worsened significantly in the
euro area, while activity in other advanced
economies was mixed. The euro area

flash estimate shows that the economy
contracted by 1.2 percent; the Japanese
economy also contracted, by 2.3 percent,
amid slowing global trade and continued
supply-chain disruptions. By contrast, U.S.
GDP growth picked up pace to reach
2.8 percent (from 1.8 percent in Q3), driven
largely by inventories (all numbers are
annualized). Recent data releases, including
PMIs for the euro area, suggest that the pace
of activity could be stabilizing somewhat
earlier than expected.
2.
Emerging economies have slowed
more than expected. The effects of past
policy tightening have contributed to a
cooling in domestic demand and so have
adverse spillovers from advanced economies.

4
These effects have been amplified by cyclical
factors and weaker confidence in the growth
outlook. After expanding at an annual rate of
between 30–40 percent earlier in 2011,
export growth for emerging economies,
notably those in Europe, fell sharply and
turned negative towards the end of the year.
The deterioration in trade appears to be
driven partly by adverse spillovers from the
euro area and supply-side disruptions.

acceptance of a broader range of collateral.
This has alleviated rollover funding pressures
on many banks in the short term. However,
in the medium to long term, efforts have to
be pursued to improve their balance sheets
and restore confidence and regain access to
market term funding, which ultimately also
depend on growth and fiscal sustainability.
The EU also made commitments at the
recent summit to strengthen the euro area’s
policy framework.

While a full-blown liquidity crisis
has been averted, sovereign stress
remains elevated in parts of the euro area,
fostering adverse financial-real feedback
loops. The ECB’s actions and the structural
and institutional reforms that have been
adopted recently have helped alleviate
financing pressures, as evidenced by reduced
sovereign
and
bank
debt
yields.
Nevertheless, yields on long-term bonds
remain at high levels (notably in Italy and
Spain). While the impact of the LTRO has not
been yet fully reflected in recent credit
developments, it has not yet led to a
restoration of interbank lending across
Europe and it is unlikely that it can turn
around private credit, which stagnated in
January, following a large drop in December.

3.
Financial markets have taken
comfort from recent steps taken by
European policy makers. The most tangible
effect has come from the 3-year ECB’s longterm refinancing operation (LTRO) and its

borrowing costs and recent bank surveys
show loan standards have tightened sharply
and are expected to continue to do so—
particularly in Italy. Accordingly, market
confidence
remains
fragile,
with
a
comprehensive approach to resolving the
sovereign debt crisis lacking and still-weak
growth prospects.
5.
Funding pressure on European
banks, while easing recently, continues, as
policies to bolster capital buffers take
effect. To avoid excessive deleveraging, the
EBA has stated banks should first use private
sources of funds to achieve capital targets,
and that any reductions in risk-weighted
assets should not reduce the flow of lending
to the real economy. The recent EBA
preliminary assessment of banks’ capital
plans suggests that, in aggregate, the
shortfalls are expected to be met primarily
through direct capital measures, which
would significantly limit the negative impact
on lending to the real economy. Measures
submitted so far (plans will be finalized by
March 1st) create an additional capital buffer
equivalent to one quarter of the initial

shortfall. Capital-raising measures account
for over 95 percent of the total increase in

capital ratios. However, further scrutiny of
individual cases will be necessary in parallel
with the discussion of banks’ plans by the
relevant colleges of supervisors.
6.
Recent capital flows and exchange
rate movements have been largely driven
by risk perceptions. A general flight to
safety depreciated many emerging market
exchange rates against the U.S. dollar in the
second half of 2011. A notable exception was
China’s real effective exchange rate, which
has recently appreciated. Capital flowed out
of emerging markets, but at a markedly
slower pace than during late 2008 or during
August-September 2011. This contributed to
a modest worsening in financial conditions,

6
as reflected in lower equity prices and higher
external bond spreads toward the end of
2011. Since the beginning of the year, risk
perceptions have improved, asset prices and
exchanges rates have recovered some lost
ground across emerging economies, and
capital inflows have resumed to emerging
Asia, Latin America, and South Africa.
Looking forward, capital flows to emerging
economies are likely to be volatile.
7.
Crude oil prices have held up
despite deteriorating global growth
prospects. The oil market has remained
relatively tight. Geopolitical risks have
intensified—notably those related to Iran—
increasing precautionary demand for oil
inventories and adding a risk premium to
spot prices. Other commodity markets have

been
faster
to
price-in
demand
developments, particularly base metals, and
food prices have declined mainly due to
improved supply prospects for 2012.

7

II. PROSPECTS
8.
Global growth is projected to slow.
Global output is projected to expand by about
3¼ percent in 2012 (Table 1)—a downward
revision of about ¾ percentage points relative
to the September 2011 World Economic
Outlook (WEO). The euro area is expected to
enter a mild recession in 2012, while other
major advanced economies face the prospect
of continued weak and bumpy growth.
Growth will also moderate further in emerging
economies. A large collapse in global demand
is expected to be avoided, based on the
assumption that policymakers in the euro area
intensify efforts to address the crisis. This
would allow for a gradual normalization of
sovereign bond premia and limit deleveraging
by euro area banks. Credit and investment in
the euro area would contract modestly, with
limited financial and trade spillovers to other
regions.

 The euro area is expected to enter a mild
recession in 2012, reflecting the increase of
sovereign and corporate bond yields,
additional fiscal consolidation, and the
effects of bank deleveraging on the real
economy. Growth in the United States is
expected to moderate over 2012, after
showing some resilience in late 2011. While
labor market improvements will help, saving

rates are likely to rise again as households
continue to repair damaged balance sheets.
In Japan, earthquake reconstruction will
continue to support activity, amid a strong
yen and a weak external environment.
 In emerging and developing economies,
growth is expected to slow relative to 2010–
11. This reflects past policy tightening (e.g.,
Brazil and China), policy slippages that have
hit confidence, adverse spillovers from
advanced economies, and lower underlying
global growth. The effects of these spillovers
will vary across countries, reflecting the
extent of linkages with advanced economies
and available policy space.
9.
Inflation should ease as demand
softens and commodity prices stabilize or
recede, but risks of damaging deflation
have increased in some G-20 advanced
economies.
 In advanced economies, excess supply and
well-anchored inflation expectations will
keep inflation pressures subdued, as the
lagged effects of higher commodity prices
wane. Inflation is projected to recede to
close to 1½ percent during 2012, down
from a peak of about 2¾ percent in 2011.
Should growth turn out lower than
expected, there is a risk that very large
output gaps would lead to a further decline
of domestic inflation to very low levels in
some countries, notably in Europe, and
deepen deflation in Japan, with damaging
consequences where debt burdens are high.
 In
emerging
economies,
inflationary
pressures are also expected to ease, as
growth slows and food price inflation
declines.

8

III. KEY RISKS
Risks remain squarely to the downside. Imminent risks for a banking crisis have diminished. The
overarching risk remains an intensified global “paradox of thrift” as households, firms, and
governments around the world reduce demand. This risk is further exacerbated by fragile financial
systems, high public deficits and debt, and already-low interest rates, making the current
environment fertile ground for multiple equilibria—self-perpetuating outcomes resulting from
pessimism or optimism, particularly in the euro area. Emerging economies face risks of a hard
landing, stemming from home-grown vulnerabilities and adverse spillovers from advanced
economies. Another key risk is a sharply higher oil price, driven by geopolitical-related supply
concerns.
10.
The key risk remains that policies do
not shift Europe toward a “good
equilibrium” and fail to break adverse
feedback loops between real, fiscal, and
financial sectors. This risk must be urgently
addressed as euro area public sector and bank
debt rollover needs are large (totalling about
23 percent of GDP during 2012). Successful
debt issuance requires a durable recovery of
market confidence about prospects for both
growth and fiscal sustainability across the euro
area.

in credit and a sharp fall in private investment
(almost 2 percent of GDP). The adverse impact
on growth intensifies concerns about fiscal
sustainability, driving up sovereign risk
premia, and forcing more front-loaded fiscal
consolidation (1 percent of GDP). Corporate
risk premia rise, increasing funding costs, and
policy rates are assumed to remain at or close
to the effective zero bound during 2012–13.
The result is that the level of euro area output
is about 4 percent lower than the WEO
forecast after 2 years. Assuming that financial
contagion to the rest of the world is more
intense than in the baseline (but weaker than
following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
2008) and trade spillovers, the level of global
output is lower by about 2 percent after
2 years relative to WEO projections.

12.
Debt sustainability remains a
concern for the United States and Japan. In
the short run, this risk might be mitigated as
the turbulence in the euro area makes
government debt of these economies more
attractive to investors. However, as long as
public debt levels are projected to rise over
the medium term and well-defined and
credible fiscal consolidation strategies are
lacking, there is the possibility of turmoil in
global
bond
and
currency
markets.
Developments in the euro area have shown
that market confidence can be quickly lost,
with damaging consequences for growth and
financial stability. This highlights the need for
urgency.




So far, policymakers in the United States
have failed to make progress toward a
credible medium-term fiscal adjustment
plan. Already-approved consolidation
measures would go some way toward
reducing the budget deficit, but do not
address underlying spending pressures
from public health care and pension
programs, and do not raise any new
revenue. Risks that key measures to
support the economy lapse in the face of
a political impasse, including an early
expiry of the existing stimulus measures
such as the payroll tax cuts, have receded.
In Japan, the immediate priority should be
to repair damaged infrastructure and get
the recovery back on track. However, there
remains an urgent need for a credible
medium-term consolidation plan to
ensure debt ratios begin falling by middecade. The government’s proposal for tax
and social security reform bill is welcome,
but passage of the legislation is uncertain.
More importantly, while the bill is a step in
the right direction, more needs to be done
to ensure fiscal sustainability.

13.
In key emerging economies, the
risks stem from the possibility of a hard
landing and adverse spillovers from
advanced economies. In a number of major
emerging economies credit expanded rapidly
over the past couple of years, increasing
financial vulnerabilities. If gains in asset prices
and credit were to unwind, the impact on
activity could be damaging. The effect could
be exacerbated further by adverse external
developments, such as weaker-than-expected
demand from advanced economies and lower
commodity prices. Until now, financial
spillovers from turbulence in advanced
economies have been modest. But financial
conditions can change quickly, leading to a
sudden stop or reversal of capital flows,
reduced availability of trade finance, or
liquidity pressures in financial systems.
However, policymakers should avoid excessive
stimulus in response to lower growth in
advanced
economies,
as
this
would
exacerbate risks of hard landing going
forward.
14.
The impact of an oil supply shock in
the Middle East could be large, if not
compensated
by
supply
increases
elsewhere. For example:


A halt of Iran’s exports to OECD
economies without offset from other
sources could trigger an initial oil price
increase of around 20-30 percent, with
other producers or emergency stock
releases likely providing some offset over
time.



A sustained blockade of the Strait of
Hormuz—through which about 40 percent
of global oil exports are shipped—would
lead
to
a
much
stronger
and
unprecedented disruption of global oil
supply.

10

IV. POLICIES
The three requirements for a more resilient recovery are: sustained but gradual fiscal adjustment;
ample liquidity and easy monetary policy, particularly in advanced economies; and greater
confidence in policymakers’ ability to act decisively. Importantly, the type, scale, and timing of
adjustment should not be the same, but depend on each country’s own circumstances, or efforts may
become self-defeating. Reestablishing confidence and resolving the current crisis requires a cohesive,
comprehensive, and cooperative package of policies across the G-20.
15.
Fiscal consolidation, structured and
paced to avoid a collapse in demand and
ensure debt sustainability, must continue in
many euro area countries, and laying out
credible medium-term adjustment plans
remains an urgent priority in key advanced
economies.




Near term. Sufficient near-term fiscal
adjustment has begun in most advanced
economies, including in the euro area.
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate freely, provided funding for
higher deficits can be secured. Overdoing
fiscal adjustment in the short run will
undermine activity, diminish popular
support for adjustment, and further
threaten market confidence. Countries
with fiscal space, especially those with very
low funding costs, should consider
slowing fiscal adjustment in 2012, while
maintaining their commitment to a
credible medium-term consolidation plan.
Euro area members benefiting from a
financial assistance program should stick
to the agreed consolidation efforts and
should fully implement the required
structural reforms.
Medium term. Policymakers should
increase efforts to formulate and
implement credible consolidation plans,
particularly in the United States and Japan.
Depending on circumstances, measures

could
include
entitlement
reforms
including new health care and pension
saving measures, and tax system reforms
to boost fiscal revenue. These measures
will create policy room to support balance
sheet repair, growth, and job creation
during this period of heightened
vulnerability.
16.
Fiscal consolidation in advanced
economies should be complemented by
other policies to mitigate adverse effects
on growth. This will require a comprehensive
and coordinated set of policies in the
following key areas.


Liquidity and Monetary Policy. Monetary
policy should continue to support growth,
as inflation expectations remain anchored
and unemployment is high. If downside
risks materialize, the Federal Reserve, Bank
of England, and Bank of Japan should
stand ready to expand unconventional
support. Targeted programs to ease credit
constraints would be also useful where the
transmission mechanism is impaired. The
ECB’s monetary policy should be highly
accommodative, consistent with its
mandate of ensuring price stability. This
could be achieved by lowering the target
policy rate, for which room exists, and, as
needed, further unconventional measures.
Also, the ECB should continue to provide
liquidity and stay fully engaged in

11
securities purchases to help improve the
prospects for financial stability.




Bank recapitalization. Some deleveraging
is unavoidable, but the way it is achieved
matters. For example, if banks shed legacy
assets or sell non-core businesses to
strong institutions, it would not necessarily
reduce credit to the economy, although
asset sales can cause declines in asset
prices whose adverse impact goes far
beyond the sellers. However, credit to the
real economy is most affected when banks
curtail new loan originations and let credit
lines and loans run off. Home authorities,
working together with host supervisors,
including at the level of supervisory
colleges, should monitor and limit
deleveraging of their banks at home and
abroad. To sever the link between
escalating banking, sovereign, and growth
problems more capital must be injected
into weak euro area banks. Importantly,
supervisors must do whatever is possible
to avoid excessively fast deleveraging that
curtails lending to the real economy. This
may require the use of public funds for
recapitalization, including for instance the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)
in economies under market pressure.
Structural reforms. Fiscal consolidation
needs to be complemented with reforms
to entitlement programs and product and
labor markets. These policies will pay off in
the medium term by helping to address
distortions
and
competitiveness
problems—the root causes of current
travails in the euro area—and thus boost
underlying growth and help improve
public debt ratio dynamics. They can also
contribute to growth in the short term by
bolstering confidence.

17.
Deeper
financial
and
fiscal
integration over the medium term across
Europe will underpin the sustainability of
the common currency. Progress on this front
now would help avoid perceptions of an
incomplete response to current challenges.


Policymakers must quickly implement and
build on the agreed “fiscal compact”. Over
time, this should be accompanied by
progress toward a transparent and
credible framework of fiscal risk sharing.
While the EFSF and the European Stability
Mechanism (ESM) are major steps in this
direction, the available capacity of the
European firewall should be increased by
around $500 billion to adequate levels. For
example, this could be achieved through
enlarging the ESM or running the existing
EFSF alongside the ESM.



Efforts should concentrate on addressing
weaker banks and repairing financial
institutions’ balance sheets. It is important
over the medium term to implement a
restructuring strategy that addresses
nonperforming assets and nonviable
banks. A companion to repairing balance
sheets should be improved disclosure of
prudential information. The EBA, for
example, should evolve to provide a
consistent regime for disclosure of
problematic assets.



Europe
must
move
towards
a
comprehensive
model
of
common
financial sector supervision and resolution,
with a common backstop and deposit
insurance, which will help build a stronger
financial system. In the meantime,
effective resolution tools that facilitate
orderly closing of cross-border banks are
required to restore financial stability.
Moving expeditiously on this reform

12
agenda, including adopting rules for
cross-border burden-sharing, requires a
high degree of political commitment.
18.
Deft crisis management is required
in Europe to successfully resolve the crisis.
Supplying sufficient liquidity will help prevent
unsustainable funding costs for banks and
sovereigns and avoid contagion. This is best
done through official sources, which could
include expanded use of the ECB’s balance
sheet and the EFSF and/or the ESM. The IMF
can also play a role and countries and
institutions outside the euro area may usefully
contribute to this process, including through
providing additional resources to the Fund.
19.
In emerging economies, the focus
should be on responding to moderating
demand, while dealing with volatile capital
flows. Circumstances differ across these
countries, as does the appropriate policy
response. In countries with high inflation and
public debt, including India and some
economies in the Middle East, a cautious
stance to policy easing is required. In the
remaining countries:


Where
inflationary
pressures
are
diminishing and fiscal fundamentals are
weak, monetary policy can be eased. But
this must be accompanied by macroprudential
and
enhanced
financial
supervision where there are risks of
overheating in some sectors (such as real
estate).



Additional social spending to support
poorer households should be pursued,

particularly in economies where inflation
pressure is expected to ease, public debt is
not high, and external surpluses are large
(e.g., China and selected emerging
economies in Asia). In China, fiscal support
could continue to be provided to the
economy by deferring consolidation plans,
lowering
social
contributions
and
consumption taxes, and increasing social
transfers.
20.
Collective action to rebalance global
demand
can
help
ensure
strong,
sustainable, and balanced growth. Ensuring
durable global rebalancing will require
continued deleveraging of households in
advanced deficit economies. This will help
ensure that fiscal consolidation is not fully
offset by worsening of private sector balance
sheets. Rebalancing in advanced deficit
economies should be complemented with
more inclusive growth and lower saving in
emerging surplus economies. This will require
financial sector reform, enhanced pension,
healthcare, and education policies, and less
intervention in foreign exchange markets.
