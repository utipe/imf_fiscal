G-20: THE PATH FROM CRISIS TO RECOVERY
October 2011
KEY POINTS


The global economy has entered a dangerous phase. Policy makers must act boldly to finish
the job they began in 2009, lest the gains from the recovery since then be lost. Collective
action can put the global economy on a path to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.



Adverse feedback loops between the real economy and the financial sector have intensified,
as private and public sector balance sheets have weakened, uncertainty has been
exacerbated by policy indecision, and demand rebalancing has stalled. Even assuming that
policies prevent downside risks materializing, projections are for an anemic recovery in major
advanced economies and a cyclical slowdown in emerging economies. Global growth is
expected to fall to about 4 percent in 2011–12.



Downside risks are severe. The immediate risk is that the global economy tips into a
downward spiral of increased uncertainty and risk aversion, dysfunctional financial markets,
unsustainable debt dynamics, falling demand, and rising unemployment. Even in a less severe
scenario, key advanced economies could suffer from a protracted period of low growth.



Policy action along three key fronts will help break the adverse feedback loop between
weaker growth and confidence, fiscal tensions, and financial fragilities. This includes well
calibrated fiscal adjustment to reassure markets; liquidity provision in the euro area to avoid
deeper dislocation and relieve funding strains; and building banks’ capital buffers in Europe.



In advanced G-20 economies, fiscal sustainability must be restored through credible mediumterm consolidation plans. Countries with high debt and facing market pressure must press
ahead with “growth-friendly” consolidation now. In others, fiscal policy should navigate
between the perils of undermining credibility and undercutting recovery, and facilitate a pickup in private demand. To alleviate prevailing market pressures in the euro area, the ECB
should continue its extended liquidity operations and sustain the Securities Market Program
(SMP) alongside the support provided by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for as
long as necessary to stabilize issuance costs for banks and sovereigns. At the same time,
banks should be urged to build capital buffers in a coordinated fashion, using national public
and euro area resources, including the EFSF, if necessary.



In emerging G-20 economies, near-term policy should focus on responding to spillovers from
moderating growth in advanced economies and heightened global risk aversion in financial
markets, subject to available policy space. In key surplus economies, fostering sustained,
inclusive medium-term growth requires removing distortions, implementing structural and
financial reforms, and moving to a more market-based exchange rate.

THE GLOBAL CONJUNCTURE
1.

Global activity has weakened
and confidence has fallen sharply.
Weakening
economic
activity
and
heightened financial stress are reinforcing
each other, reflecting, fundamentally, the
inadequate repair of balance sheets across
major advanced economies. The dual
rebalancing acts needed to secure strong,
sustainable, and balanced growth—a
handover from public to private demand
in major advanced economies, and
stronger domestic demand growth in
external surplus economies—have stalled.

2.

Mutually-reinforcing
macrofinancial stresses have risen again, and
sharply. Concerns over the sustainability
of public debt in the euro area have
intensified and broadened to some of the
area’s core economies, heightening fears
over the health of the area’s banks. Bank
equity prices have fallen sharply, credit
default spreads have widened, and
funding access for some banks has been

reduced. The direct spillover to EU banks
from the perceived increase in sovereign
credit risks from high-spread countries
since the outset of the crisis is estimated
at around €200 billion.1 Spillovers outside
of the euro area are intensifying, with
financial institutions reliant on wholesale
funding also coming under pressure.
Thanks to exceptional liquidity support
from key central banks, interbank funding
stresses are still less elevated than at the
time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
2008, and equity prices are still above
post-Lehman lows. However, sovereign
debt stresses are now more elevated in
Europe, and this has led to higher
perceived risks of some European banks.

Commodity prices have fallen
and are being affected by the same
global factors as exchange rates in
emerging economies. In particular, the
outlook for demand has deteriorated and
risk aversion has increased. Commodities
more sensitive to the economic cycle, such
as metals, have fallen most sharply but
recent declines have been broad and
include both crude oil and food. This also

Exchange rates of emerging
economies and some commodity

depreciations against the U.S. dollar

been larger for emerging economies with
deeper, more liquid financial markets,
flexible exchange rates, and geographical
proximity to the euro area. These moves,

partly reflects supply factors, including
increased oil output from OPEC members,
notably Saudi Arabia, to offset supply
losses from Libya and upward revisions to
still-low grain inventories in the United
States. Physical activity in commodity
markets is still robust, largely due to
emerging markets and China, but slowing
activity
indicators
suggest
some
moderation ahead.

6.

Against this backdrop, staff
projects a weak, uneven, and bumpy
recovery, subject to major downside
risks. The September 2011 World
Economic Outlook projections show that
the United States, euro area, and Japan
are projected to grow by only around
1½ percent in 2011–12, reflecting weak

financial and household balance sheets
that are holding back private demand. In
emerging and developing economies, a
mixture of weaker external demand,
capacity constraints, and policy tightening
is expected to lower growth from about
7½ percent in 2010 to 6 percent in 2012.
Crucially, these projections assume that
current policy commitments will be met
and thus macro-financial conditions will
not deteriorate further. If downside risks
were to materialize, growth would be
substantially lower.

7.

A weak recovery means that
unemployment will remain high in
many economies. In the United States,
exceptionally high job losses during the
crisis followed lackluster employment
generation during the previous decade,
leaving households more worried than any
time since the 1980s about future income
prospects.
Persistently
high
unemployment may result in a permanent
loss of work skills. Unemployment rates
are also high in Europe, especially in the
crisis-hit economies, as well as in
emerging economies such as the Middle
East and North Africa region, where
structural unemployment has contributed
to political instability.

KEY RISKS
8.

Downside risks have increased
and are severe. The overarching risk is of
a global “paradox of thrift” as households,
firms, and governments around the world
reduce demand, with many advanced
economies unable to lower policy rates

further. Immediate risks are centered in
the major advanced G-20 economies,
principally the euro area and the United
States. Uncertainties about the program in
Greece are fuelling market fears of a
disorderly default that would have large
spillover effects.

5




Sovereign debt and bank funding
pressures in the euro area: High
sovereign funding costs and low
growth rates risk undermining fiscal
sustainability and raising already
intense pressure on banks holding
such sovereign debt. Conditions in
European wholesale funding markets
could worsen further, due to heavy
reliance on these markets. The
financial stress already spreading to
the rest of the world would escalate.
While deleveraging by banks is
already taking place, in an extreme
case, major unexpected defaults or
failures in the financial system could
trigger large adverse spillovers in the
real economy, notably by banks
further cutting back their lending and
shrinking sharply their balance sheets.
Household
and
public
debt
sustainability in the United States:
Household and fiscal stresses could
produce severe downside scenarios.
Recent declines in financial asset
prices
have
further
reduced
household net wealth already hit by
the
housing
market
collapse,
damaged confidence, and contributed
to lower spending growth. Debt
deflation could weigh on activity for
many years. Sharp near-term fiscal
cutbacks
without
long-term
expenditure or revenue reforms
would further weaken the outlook for
growth. Continued low growth,
without necessary fiscal medium-term
consolidation, could cause an increase
in risk premiums and interest rates on

U.S. bonds, with adverse effects for
public debt sustainability.

9.

Emerging G-20 economies could
be hit severely by a further downturn
and an intensification of financial stress
in advanced economies.


There are now clear signs of a real
slowdown in several emerging
economies. A further deterioration in
global financial conditions, including
due to funding stress among euro
area or wholesale-funding dependent
banks or concerns about fiscal
sustainability in major advanced
economies, raises the risks of abrupt
and potentially large capital outflows.
Notwithstanding their resilience so
far, emerging G-20 economies exhibit
vulnerability to shifts in global risk
aversion—recent
exchange
rate
depreciations have been associated
with a pick-up in capital outflows
from local markets and increased
demand for hedging of currency risk.
The experience of 2008 underscores
that capital reversals can intensify
rapidly and economies that have large
direct linkages with the euro area
banking system would be most at
risk.



Trade-dependent
emerging
economies would be especially
vulnerable to a sustained downturn
in advanced economy growth, but
also market stresses that impede
the provision of trade financing.
Weaker global growth would reduce
commodity prices and adversely
affect the export revenues of

6
commodity exporters. Analysis of
downside scenarios for GDP growth
in advanced economies suggests that
such effects could be substantial.



Weaker
global
demand
and
intensified global financial stress
could
expose
underlying
vulnerabilities from excessive credit
growth (e.g., borrowing by local
government
vehicles,
incautious
infrastructure projects, expanding offbalance sheet activities by banks, and
property bubbles). Declining real
activity and volatile capital flows
could therefore undercut high real
estate prices in various emerging
economies, raising nonperforming
loans, and thereby setting off another
deleveraging cycle.

Outlook for more details of a similar exercise.

10.

Global risks are closely linked
and rise and fall together. Furthermore,
as elaborated in the IMF Spillover Reports,
when risks materialize, they are rapidly
transmitted across the world by financial
and commodities markets. This would
compound the negative effects from trade
channels.

POLICIES
11.

Policy responses are urgently
needed to decisively reduce rising
uncertainty and fear. The world economy
has entered a dangerous phase in which
negative developments could quickly run
beyond the control of policy makers.
Policy actions along three fronts will help
break the adverse feedback loop between
weaker growth and confidence, fiscal
tensions, and financial fragilities:


Credible medium-term fiscal plans,
which would create space for
providing further support for
fledgling
recovery,
and
well
calibrated and appropriately paced

fiscal adjustment in the near term to
anchor investor confidence. This need
to
be
supported
by
rapid
implementation of structural reforms
to raise growth and enhance debt
sustainability;


Continued liquidity provision and
measures to stabilize issuance costs
for banks and sovereigns in Europe
in the short-run. This is an imperative
for avoiding deeper dislocation and
relieving funding strains that remain at
heightened levels, notably because of
the uncertainty about Greece; and

7
Support for banks to rebuild capital
buffers in a coordinated fashion,
using public funds if necessary.



12.

Financial
repair:
strengthen
capital buffers; restructure and resolve
weak banks. Along with addressing
sovereign tensions, removing uncertainty
about the resilience of banks is the top
priority for the euro area. Recovery in
advanced economies will need readilyavailable credit to allow easy monetary
conditions to pass through. Building bank
capital buffers will help to achieve this by
breaking the adverse feedback loop
between
rising
sovereign
spreads,
deteriorating bank funding, and flagging
activity. Policymakers should urge banks in
need of capital to raise it from private
sources, and either restructure or resolve
weak banks. But public capital injections
may also be necessary. National backstops
should be used where fiscal space exists.
Ultimately, in some European cases, this
may well entail the use of pooled euro
area resources, including EFSF funds. This
might necessitate additional measures to
Figure 7. European Bank Core Tier 1 Ratios
(percent of risk-weighted assets)

13.

Fiscal repair: achieve sustainable
balances, while supporting growth.
Advanced G-20 economies must articulate
credible medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans with specific measures embedded in
a realistic macroeconomic framework. This
would create more policy space for nearterm support to growth and employment
if needed. In the event of a further
significant slowdown in growth, a number
of these economies have scope to slow
their current pace of consolidation, if
offset by a commitment of additional
tightening later.


In the United States, the proposed
American Jobs Act would provide
needed
near-term
support.
However, parallel and credible
medium-term fiscal adjustment plan
that raises revenues and contains the
growth of entitlement spending
remains essential.



Japan’s near-term fiscal stance is
appropriate given the need to
rebuild after the earthquake, but a
comprehensive and ambitious plan to
put public debt on a sustainable
footing over the medium term
remains essential.



In most other advanced G-20
economies (e.g., Australia, Canada,
Germany, Korea, and the United
Kingdom),
current
plans
are
appropriate, but near-term tightening
should also slow if growth threatens
to be substantially lower than
projected,
with
compensating
stronger medium-term adjustment.



14.

Economies facing adverse private
funding conditions—such as those
with
IMFand
EU-supported
programs—have little choice but to
press
ahead
with
current
consolidation plans.

Household balance sheet repair:
In the United States, halting the spiral of
foreclosures, falling house prices and
deteriorating household spending is
essential. To help work off problems in the
housing sector, expanding the existing
mortgage refinancing and modification
programs would be helpful, although the
authorities’ existing efforts in this area
face a plethora of political and technical
constraints. More radically, consideration
could also be given to allowing the courts
to modify the terms of residential
mortgages.

15.

Monetary
policy:
maintain
accommodation. Given falling confidence
and activity as well as well-anchored
inflation expectations, monetary policy in
advanced G-20 economies should remain
very accommodative. There is scope for
lower ECB policy rates. The Federal
Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of
Japan should stand ready to continue their
deployment of unconventional measures
and take further steps if needed.
Prudential authorities will need to be
watchful of risks flowing from low interest
rates.

16.

Emerging G-20 economies need
to be nimble in dealing with potentially
adverse
spillovers
from
advanced
economies, and continue to strengthen
macroeconomic
policy
frameworks.
Monetary policy should be the first
response to spillovers from advanced
economies as long as inflationary
pressures remain in check. Fiscal positions
should generally aim at rebuilding policy
space. However, if growth begins to slow
substantially, emerging economies with
fiscal space (China, Indonesia, Mexico, and
South Africa) should ease the pace of
consolidation, including by allowing
automatic stabilizers to fully operate. Most
emerging G-20 economies need to bolster
their financial stability frameworks to cope
with volatile capital flows, including
notably from sharp swings in global risk
aversion.

9

COLLECTIVE ACTION
17.

Collective action can set the
stage for a return to strong,
sustainable, and balanced growth.
Policies should fit individual country
circumstances, but if all economies work
together, the risks of downward spirals
can be significantly reduced and a
stronger, more even recovery achieved.
This is true for the urgent challenges faced
today—notably addressing pressures in
the financial system—and over the
medium term.

18.

External rebalancing, now more
important than ever, requires collective
action. Households in advanced deficit
economies must continue deleveraging, in
part to ensure that ongoing fiscal
consolidation is not offset by deterioration
in the private saving-investment balance.
At the same time, sustained, more
inclusive, growth in emerging surplus
economies that lowers saving—including
through reduced distortions, better
pension, healthcare, and education
systems, together with less (sterilized)
intervention
in
foreign
exchange
markets—can help offset weaker demand
in major advanced economies and
support global growth.

19.

Coordinated
policies
could
achieve impressive gains for the global
economy. Simulations prepared by IMF
staff in collaboration with OECD staff for
the Mutual Assessment Process suggest
that joint actions by G-20 members aimed
at the priorities above could result in an

overall increase of
1½ percent by 2016.

20.

Coordination is essential to
reduce the likelihood and impact of
another crisis. Significant progress has
been made, but countries urgently need
to implement agreed regulatory reforms,
while enhancing prudential supervision
and
domestic
resolution
toolkits.
Multilateral consistency is crucial in three
specific areas: systemic capital surcharges
for
systemically
important
banks;
coordinated crisis management that guide
information exchange and cross-border
bank
resolutions.;
and
greater
transparency, in particular of the shadow
banking system, and, as appropriate,
expansion of the supervisory perimeter.
Further progress will require increased
cooperation from all stakeholders.

21.

The G-20 must strive to provide
further
impetus
to
ensuring
a
successful completion of the WTO Doha
Round. A Doha conclusion would boost
global welfare and send a strong signal for
international cooperation by providing
new market access and adding security to
trading
relationships
and
limiting
protectionist potential. In the meantime,
maintaining the credibility of the
multilateral trading system is crucial given
Doha’s paralysis. Policymakers must resist
rising trade protectionist pressures arising
from high unemployment in advanced
economies and the lack of exchange rate
appreciation
in
some
emerging

10
economies. In addition, G-20 economies
should
also
resist
“financial
protectionism.” In particular, in the context
of deleveraging to improve the balance
sheet positions, banks should be
discouraged from relying largely on
liquidating their foreign asset holdings,
since this can have deleterious spillover
effects.

22.

The path to recovery has
narrowed, but the path is still open, if
action is taken now. Countries must
adopt comprehensive action across all
policy levers, and implement them in a
globally-coordinated way to secure
strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.
