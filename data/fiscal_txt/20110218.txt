EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global economic recovery is advancing, albeit at an uneven pace. Global GDP increased at a
stronger-than-expected annualized rate of over 3½ percent in 2010Q3.


In G-20 advanced economies, activity has moderated less than expected, but growth remains
subdued and insufficient to significantly reduce still-high unemployment.



In G-20 emerging economies, growth remains robust, buoyed by strong domestic demand and the
recovery of global trade, still-accommodative policy stances, and resurgent capital flows. However,
inflationary pressures are building, and there are emerging signs of overheating in some economies.

While financial turbulence has receded in recent weeks, underlying stresses in peripheral euro
area economies remain unresolved and are linked to the core through financial exposures. Markets
are looking for more capacity and flexibility of the current crisis management facilities and clarification
about the permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM). ECB intervention and strengthening of
national policy actions in countries under pressure have led to some recent positive market
developments, including the successful bond issuance by the European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF). Nonetheless, banks face continued funding strains and many remain reliant on ECB liquidity
support, while banking and sovereigns risks remain closely intertwined.
In line with the two-speed recovery, downside risks remain elevated in advanced economies, while
overheating risks are growing in emerging economies. Intensification and broadening of financial
sector strains resulting from sovereign and banking sector risks in the euro area periphery is a
significant risk to the recovery in the region and possibly beyond. Overheating and building inflationary
pressures in some emerging economies, exacerbated by large capital flows and rising commodity prices
(with adverse consequences for lower income countries), and a potentially steep correction of property
prices in China have emerged as pertinent risks to the recovery. Another downside risk stems from
insufficient progress in developing medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, especially in the United
States and Japan.
Cooperative and well-timed policy initiatives across the G-20 are critical to sustain the global
recovery, while reducing global imbalances.


In G-20 advanced economies, the most urgent requirements are for comprehensive and rapid actions
to overcome sovereign and financial stresses in the euro area and accelerate progress in developing
medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. Rapid progress in the repair and reform of financial
systems—critical to the normalization of credit conditions— would help reduce the burden on
monetary and fiscal policy to support the recovery, and potentially help stem volatile capital flows
to emerging economies.



In G-20 emerging economies, the key policy challenge is to keep overheating pressures in check and
respond appropriately to capital inflows. In key surplus economies, overheating pressures can be
alleviated by permitting currency appreciation, facilitating a healthy rebalancing from external to
internal demand.

2
Global Economic Prospects and Policy Challenges1
The global economic recovery is advancing. However, the recovery remains uneven, with
downside risks in advanced economies remaining elevated, while overheating risks are growing
in emerging economies. Financial sector strains resulting from sovereign and banking sector
fragilities in the euro area periphery represent a significant risk to recovery in the region and
possibly beyond. Another downside risk stems from insufficient progress in developing medium-term
fiscal consolidation plans in the United States and Japan. Rising overheating pressures in some
emerging economies, exacerbated by large capital flows and rising commodity prices, and a
potentially steep correction in property prices in China have also surfaced as pertinent concerns.
I. A TWO-SPEED RECOVERY IS ONGOING
1.
In G-20 advanced economies, the pace of growth in the second half of 2010 was
somewhat stronger than expected, but insufficient to appreciably lower unemployment. The
recovery in many advanced economies continues to be slow and sluggish, amid persistently high
unemployment, significant excess capacity, and subdued private demand. In the United States,
this has prompted further monetary and fiscal stimulus, notwithstanding an already challenging
fiscal outlook. Meanwhile, in the euro area periphery, austerity measures prompted by market
pressures continue to hamper growth in the short term.




In the United States, data showed some
strengthening of the recovery in the fourth
quarter, owing to robust growth in private
consumption and exports, and a sizable drop
in imports. Consumer durables posted
particularly strong growth in the quarter, a
tentative sign that households are becoming
more positive about the economic outlook.
However, looking ahead, continued
weaknesses in employment and income
growth, a sizable overhang in housing
markets, and balance sheet repair are expected
to remain a drag on private demand.

In Japan, after a strong third quarter, the recovery likely hit a temporary soft patch at the

end of the year, reflecting mainly the withdrawal of policy stimulus. Recent indicators
point to a resumption of the recovery this year supported by growing exports, especially
to the rest of the region. Private demand is expected to recover gradually due to the
sluggish labor market and subdued business sentiment.

Growth performance has varied substantially in the euro area, both within the core and
across the countries in the periphery. Data suggest that output in the euro area as a whole
expanded at about 1½ percent annualized in the second half of 2010. However, while
growth in Germany has remained robust,

2.
In many G-20 advanced economies, high unemployment and balance sheet strains
continue to be a drag on a private-sector-led recovery, and core inflation remains low.


In several key G-20 advanced economies, unemployment rates have persisted at high
levels, paralleling their subdued recoveries. Persistent weakness in labor markets is a
concern not only due to the economic impact, but also for the large human and social
costs of high long-term unemployment. In

decades in Germany, while it has persisted
at high levels in other countries (e.g.,
Ireland and Spain). While core inflation has generally remained low in G-20 advanced
economies, reflecting still-large output gaps and moderate recoveries, headline inflation
rates have been edging up recently in response to rising commodity prices.

Private sector balance sheets remain under stress in a number of advanced G-20
economies, as households and banks seek to reduce debt and deleverage. While the scope
and intensity of such stress varies across the advanced economies, on-going balance-sheet
repair and weaknesses in employment and income growth represent a significant drag on
private demand and recovery prospects.

3.
Growth in G-20 emerging economies remains robust, but signs of overheating are
emerging in some economies. Robust domestic demand and the recovery of global production
continue to power the expansion in emerging economies. Strong growth in key emerging
economies—China, India, Indonesia, and Turkey—and growing intra-regional trade, particularly
in Asia, is offsetting weaker demand from advanced economies. Among G-20 emerging
economies, with some exceptions (e.g., Mexico and South Africa), unemployment has been
trending downward as the expansions have gathered momentum. Output gaps have been closing
rapidly, and some countries have begun to experience excess demand. This, combined with
rising food and commodity prices, and in some cases strong capital flows, is fueling inflationary
pressures in many emerging economies, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Russia.

Commodity prices have risen sharply in 2010, largely due to unexpectedly strong
cyclical demand and commodity-specific supply developments, and are foreseen to remain
high in the near term. Upward price pressures from these factors should ease somewhat
through 2011, with the prospect of ongoing supply constraints representing a key risk. The IMF
commodity price index has now recovered more than half of the decline from the cyclical peak in
July 2008.




Food price gains, driven mostly by weatherrelated supply shocks, have been particularly
prominent and, as a group, food is now within
touching distance of 2008 peaks. The recent
Middle East social unrest may place further
upward pressure on food prices, if large grain
importers step-up their purchases to ensure
domestic stability and restrain prices in
domestic food markets.

In the January 2011 WEO update, oil prices for 2011 were projected to be around
13 percent higher than forecast in the October 2010 WEO ($79 a barrel), largely due to
unanticipated demand growth. In recent weeks, social unrest in the Middle East has
increased concerns about oil supply disruptions and pushed prices higher, although until
now, actual supplies have remained unaffected. Robust oil demand growth in excess of
non-OPEC supply growth is expected to increase the call on OPEC capacity from 2011.
OPEC producers’ decisions will play a key role in price dynamics. They are widely
expected to use their capacity more elastically with prices at $100 or above, especially as
inventory-to-use ratio are approaching average levels of the cycle, and preliminary

6
estimates of OPEC production in December and January seem to corroborate this view.
Nevertheless, there is uncertainty about OPEC producers’ price targets. Reflecting these
developments, the IMF’s current baseline petroleum price projection for 2011 is now for
$94.75 a barrel, up from $89.50 in the January 2011 WEO update.
5.
Financial turbulence has receded in recent weeks, but underlying stresses in
peripheral euro-area economies remain unresolved and are linked to the core through
financial exposures.


Markets are anticipating that European policymakers will significantly strengthen their
response to the ongoing crisis. They are looking for more capacity and flexibility of the
current crisis management facilities and clarification about the permanent European
Stability Mechanism (ESM), in particular about the extent of private sector participation,
the application of collective action clauses, and the status of existing sovereign debt
holders. ECB intervention early in the year and strengthening of national policy action in
countries under pressure have led to some recent positive market developments, including
the successful bond issuance by the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM)
and European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).



Nonetheless, banks face continued funding strains, especially those dependent on
wholesale funding and subject to market concerns relating to their risk exposure and asset
values in countries that experienced real estate bubbles. Many banks remain reliant on
ECB liquidity support. Banking and sovereigns risks are closely intertwined, as
evidenced by CDS spreads.

6.
Longer-maturity sovereign yields and equity prices in the United States have risen
as growth prospects have improved. The recent run of positive economic data have brightened
market perceptions of U.S. growth prospects. Despite concerns about medium-term debt
sustainability, the December fiscal package does not seem to have contributed much to recent

7
rises in bond yields. The rise of about ¾ of a percentage point in 10-year Treasury yields since
early November appears largely due to higher real interest rates, with break-even inflation
expectations (inferred from inflation-indexed bonds) remaining little changed since a rise
following Chairman Bernanke’s speech at Jackson Hole, which hinted that a second round of
quantitative easing may be necessary. However, further rises in bond yields due to fiscal
concerns remain a key risk to the U.S. fiscal outlook and global growth, particularly if a credible
consolidation plan is not expedited.
7.
Capital flows to emerging markets are continuing but volatility has increased
somewhat. During the three months through October 2010, emerging market equity prices
increased by almost 9 percent, while foreign currency-denominated bond spreads tightened by
30 basis points, with gains shared broadly across regions. Recently, equity markets have been
less buoyant, while fixed income volatility has generally increased and ex-post returns to
emerging market bonds turned negative, according to JPMorgan’s Emerging Market Bond Index.
In contrast to the bond-heavy allocations during the first nine months of 2010, emerging market
debt and equity mutual fund contributions since October suggest more balanced portfolio capital
inflows.
8.
There have been regional divergences in exchange rate responses to net capital
inflows. In particular:

towards global rebalancing. For instance, the Chinese renminbi continues to remain
substantially undervalued in real effective terms.



Countries in emerging Asia generally compete more directly with China in third markets
than Latin American countries, and the fear of being ‘priced out’ of these markets in Asia
is providing a strong incentive to limit appreciation against the Chinese renminbi. In
contrast, several Latin American countries as well as South Africa have benefited from



The real effective values of the euro and the Japanese yen are broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals, while the U.S. dollar remains on the strong side of
fundamentals. Some further real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar would help
ensure a sustained decline of the U.S. current account deficit towards a level more
consistent with medium-term fundamentals, helping to support more balanced growth.

2011 and improving domestic demand, while the effects of the inventory cycle fade. The
most likely prospect in the euro area is for a continued, moderate recovery in 2011, with
weakening public demand and still-sluggish private demand. Despite support from fiscal
stimulus, Japan is expected to have a modest pace of recovery in 2011, reflecting ongoing
weakness in domestic demand.


Growth in G-20 emerging economies is expected to remain buoyant. Domestic demand
will remain strong, underpinning growth as demand from G-20 advanced economies
remains subdued. However, activity in these economies, particularly in export-oriented
Asia, will remain linked to demand in advanced economies.

10.
Under the baseline projection, financial conditions in the private sector are expected
to improve across most regions, but risks and challenges remain. Financial conditions in
most advanced economies remained broadly stable or improved during the second half of 2010,
and the trend is expected to continue in 2011.

and medium-sized U.S. banks to commercial real estate.



Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporates, notably in the United States, made a strong
rebound in the second half of 2010, spurred by historically low borrowing costs. The
outlook for U.S. Treasury yields is uncertain, with an improving growth outlook pushing
up yields and quantitative easing holding them back. The sluggish recovery in the U.S.
and continued high saving in key emerging Asian economies look set to keep U.S. real
yields close to historical lows through 2011.



Securitization markets remain impaired in the U.S., with issuance of mortgage-backed
securities continuing to be weak and heavily reliant on government-sponsored entities.
Asset-backed-securities linked to consumer credit products saw weak sales volumes,
reflecting tight credit conditions. Securitization volumes in Europe remained soft in 2010,

10
and lower than the previous year, in sharp contrast to the strong rebound in covered bond
issuance over the same period.
11.
External rebalancing is expected to remain modest. Global imbalances declined with
the collapse in global trade during the crisis, but have increased somewhat during 2010 and are
foreseen to remain elevated over the medium term. Surpluses of oil-exporting countries are
expected to narrow marginally, and balances of other emerging surplus and advanced deficit
economies are expected to widen. Importantly, many of the distortions underlying the large precrisis imbalances remain—including undervalued exchange rates in key emerging surplus
economies and insufficient domestic saving in advanced deficit economies. Without policies
targeted at correcting these underlying distortions, global imbalances will not narrow on a
durable basis, and threaten global growth prospects.

Downside risks remain elevated in advanced economies
12.
Tensions in the euro area periphery pose a significant risk to the recovery in the
region and possibly beyond. The risk is exacerbated by inadequate progress in the repair of
financial institutions in the euro area. Markets are concerned that adverse spillovers between the
banking and sovereign sectors in the periphery may affect the banks in the core, given their
exposure to the euro area periphery.


BIS banking statistics suggest that national banks’ foreign claims on euro area economies
facing varying degrees of market pressure is sizeable. As of 2010Q3, on a consolidated
basis (netting out claims between parent and affiliate banks located in host countries),
estimates indicate that foreign claims on Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain by banks in

11
the rest of the euro area are around 10 percent of the region’s GDP and around 80 percent
of its banks’ equity, with claims on Greece and Ireland accounting for about 40 percent.


While there are backstops in place through the ECB and the EFSF and proposals have
been tabled for a permanent crisis management mechanism (ESM), a more
comprehensive approach is necessary to deal with the sovereign and financial turbulence
and secure a durable exit from the crisis. This will require a decisive action on an
expedited basis.

13.
Another downside risk stems from insufficient progress in developing medium-term
fiscal consolidation plans in the United States and Japan. The stimulus measures
implemented recently in the United States and Japan make it more challenging to ensure
medium-term fiscal sustainability.


In the United States, the recent fiscal measures are expected to deliver only a modest
increase in growth, while coming at a significant fiscal cost. The U.S fiscal deficit is now
projected to be 10¾ percent of GDP in 2011 (more than double that of the euro area), and
gross government debt is projected to exceed 110 percent of GDP in 2016. Achieving the
Toronto commitment of halving deficit by 2013 appears highly unlikely, requiring a very
large adjustment—roughly 5 percentage points of GDP in primary structural terms.
Meanwhile, a continued absence of a credible medium term fiscal strategy threatens to
eventually drive up U.S. interest rates, disrupt financial markets, and adversely affect
global growth prospects.



In Japan, the overall deficit is only expected to narrow modestly (by a ¼ percentage
point) to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting some recently-approved expenditure
increases. A deficit reduction of only about 1 percent of GDP is projected for 2012.
Recently, Standard and Poor’s downgraded Japan’s sovereign credit rating to AA-,
highlighting increasing concerns over medium-term fiscal sustainability.

Risks of a hard landing are rising in emerging markets
14.
In emerging economies, the key risks pertain to overheating, a rapid rise of
inflationary pressures, and the risk of a hard landing.


Inflationary pressures are building in emerging economies, albeit with some
differentiation across and within regions. With rapidly-rising food and commodity prices,
headline inflation is already above target in some Latin American countries and is rising
fast in some countries in Asia and Eastern Europe. Central Banks recognize the threat of
escalating inflation, but some appear to be signaling that policy settings will remain
accommodative in the near term. The People’s Bank of China, for example, announced
that the inflation target will be raised from 3 percent to 4 percent.

12


Meanwhile, the expectation of low interest rates in advanced economies for an extended
period of time will continue to contribute to capital flows to emerging economies. While
capital inflows could promote rebalancing from external to domestic demand in emerging
economies, large and volatile capital inflows could also pose policy challenges. If
countries do not use existing policy levers, large capital flows may contribute to risks of
overheating, a deterioration of current account deficits beyond what is already assumed in
the baseline in some countries (e.g., Brazil, India, South Africa, and Turkey), and asset
price bubbles that could undermine economic prospects.



If left unchecked, rising inflationary pressures could become ingrained in inflation
expectations, threatening central bank credibility and macro stability. Inflationary
concerns will be exacerbated further if commodity prices continue to rise over the short
to medium term, notably for countries with a poor record of keeping inflation in check.



Under the above circumstances, if economic growth continues to gain momentum and
inflationary pressures continue to build, it could set the stage for a hard landing across
many of these economies.

15.
In addition to well-known downside risks associated with real estate in major
advanced economies, an emerging risk to the global recovery stems from a potentially steep
price correction in Chinese property markets. Residential real estate prices in some of China's
larger cities have risen rapidly since the crisis, spurred initially by stimulative policies aimed at
easing restrictions on real estate lending and subsequently by strong income growth, high
savings, and limited alternate investment vehicles. Over the past year, the authorities have
stepped up efforts to rein in property prices, recently announcing a range of measures, including
raising the minimum down-payment for second-home buyers and enforced a 5½ percent business
tax on properties sold within 5 years. Given the government guarantees in place, financial sector
risks threaten the fiscal outlook. While it is difficult to predict how significant the stress from
potential property price correction would be, if these risks are realized, there could potentially be
global ramifications.
III. POLICY CHALLENGES
Cooperative and well-timed policy initiatives—to reduce vulnerabilities and rebalance growth—
are needed to sustain the global recovery. In the advanced economies, the most urgent tasks are
to alleviate financial stresses in the euro area, develop credible fiscal consolidation plans, boost
job creation, and accelerate financial reforms. The key policy challenge in emerging economies
is to keep overheating pressures in check and respond appropriately to capital inflows. In key
surplus economies, overheating pressures can be alleviated by permitting currency appreciation,
facilitating a healthy rebalancing from external to internal demand.
16.
Addressing risks in the euro area will require further comprehensive, rapid, and
decisive policy action by Europe’s leaders. In particular:

13


Euro-area-wide mechanisms to support member countries need to be strengthened to
durably bolster market confidence. This requires: (i) further national action aimed at
securing fiscal sustainability, bank soundness, and growth; and (ii) ensuring that the
structure of the EFSM and EFSF, and the envisioned ESM, has the ability to quickly raise
sufficient resources at low interest rates and flexibly deploy them to address funding and
liquidity problems, under proper conditionality, with a view to support fiscal
sustainability.



The transition to the permanent crisis management mechanism (ESM) needs to be
managed carefully with further clarification of the specifics of how it will operate,
including the extent of private sector participation, the application of collective action
clauses, and the status of existing sovereign debt holders.



Repair and reform of financial systems—critical to the normalization of credit conditions
in several countries and to prevent contagion—needs to be accelerated. Concern about
asset values and risky exposures should be addressed by forcing banks to build capital
buffers, while unviable business models need to be unwound. This would help reduce the
burden on monetary and fiscal policy to support the recovery, and minimize the real
consequences of deleveraging. In this context, the new round of EU-wide stress test
should be transparent, sufficiently stringent, and accompanied by contingent plans for
quick recapitalization or resolution of banks to reassure markets.



Further strengthening of the economic governance of the euro area to prevent future
crises would greatly enhance confidence. Building on current proposals, the preventive
arm of the Stability and Growth Pact should be enhanced and the procedure to correct
imbalances made more binding. Similarly, to decouple banking and sovereign risks and
make financial integration safer, a pan-European crisis management and resolution
framework for financial institutions with an EU-wide fiscal backstop and a more
centralized approach to supervision should be established. This should go a step beyond
current plans to foster better cooperation and coordination among national authorities.

17.
Greater commitment is needed to ensure that fiscal policies will restore mediumterm debt sustainability in advanced economies. The vulnerability of some sovereigns
emphasizes the urgency of formulating credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation plans—not
just for countries in the euro periphery, but also for other advanced economies. In the near term,
a solidifying of the recovery and diminishing deflationary risks in many large advanced
economies creates room for current fiscal consolidation plans to be accelerated. Given recent
stimulus measures, the United States and Japan need to strengthen their adjustment credentials
by specifying the measures they intend to adopt to honor their commitments to reduce deficits
and debt. Those advanced economies that came under renewed market pressure should
underscore their commitment to their deficit targets and set up contingency plans to ensure that
adjustment goals are met.

14


The recently announced tax cuts in the U.S. are projected to only have a modest impact
on growth outcomes, but have a large budgetary cost. It has thus become even more
important to articulate a credible fiscal consolidation plan, including entitlement reforms,
caps on discretionary spending, higher revenues through reforms of the tax system, and
the establishment or strengthening of fiscal institutions. Plans should build on
constructive ideas from the Fiscal Commission and others.



Successful fiscal adjustment will require medium-term consolidation plans to be
accompanied by structural reforms that increase competitiveness, particularly in the euro
area and Japan. These policies would raise potential growth and help to support fiscal
solvency in the long term. Reforms are particularly needed in the areas of labor and
product and services markets, such as those that facilitate greater competition (and lower
markups), lower hiring costs, reduce long-term unemployment (by facilitating re-entry),
encourage job search, matching, and mobility, and eliminate dual labor markets.

18.
With inflationary expectations well anchored, accommodative monetary policy in
major advanced economies remains appropriate for now. High unemployment and large
output gaps are keeping wages and inflation expectations in the major advanced economies in
check, notwithstanding large increases in food and energy prices. Continuing monetary policy
accommodation is thus the right policy from a domestic perspective, considering also that the
recovery is expected to remain sluggish going forward. From an external perspective, however,
there is concern that quantitative easing in the United States could result in a flood of capital. In
economies where recovery is already well established, policymakers will need to pay increasing
attention to building inflationary pressure. Central banks should continue to stand ready to
address liquidity problems in the banking sector, particularly in the euro area.
19.
Sharp food price increases pose a particular challenge for many emerging and
developing economies. The recent food price increases come in the wake of the deepest crisis
since the Great Depression, when countries are more vulnerable and have, in general, less fiscal
space. In addition to the inflationary implications, the rapid increase in food prices may have
adverse social implications, particularly in low income countries (LICs). To minimize the social
and economic costs from rapid food price increases, policymakers would need to: (i) avoid
discretionary policies, such as export bans and taxes and price controls, that seek to insulate
domestic markets, as such actions can increase world food price volatility; (ii) accommodate
first-round effects, but be ready to tighten policies to avoid second-round effects that could result
in persistent inflation; and (iii) ensure that the poor are protected, ideally through targeted and
cost effective social safety net programs. The IMF also stands ready to boost its financial support
to LICs and other member countries to help them stem the adverse effects of rapid food price
increases.
20.
The macroeconomic policy stance in major emerging economies will need to
increasingly reflect rising inflation and overheating pressures. The appropriate policy stance

15
will need to reflect both individual country circumstances and the intensity of these pressures.
For instance, in G-20 emerging economies with flexible exchange rate regimes, and notably
where real-exchange rates are at levels that look increasingly overvalued from a medium-term
perspective, greater emphasis may need to be placed on fiscal tightening (e.g., Brazil) or
monetary as well as fiscal tightening (e.g., India). In other emerging G-20 economies, greater
emphasis will need to be placed on allowing exchange rates to appreciate. For instance, in China,
a nominal appreciation of the renminbi would both promote the transition to medium-term
rebalancing and help contain inflationary pressures.
21.
Many emerging economies will continue to face policy challenges in managing large
and volatile capital flows. Capital flows should be viewed as an opportunity, since they allow
emerging economies to borrow at lower interest rates from the rest of the world and can help
these economies rebalance. Capital flows to emerging economies are to a significant extent a
longer-term phenomenon, driven by fundamentals, and financial development and structural
reforms will be important in helping absorb these flows productively. That said, they could also
pose challenges. Capital flows can threaten macro stability and financial stability, by leading to
excessive credit growth and localized asset bubbles. In response to these concerns, countries
should fully utilize macroeconomic and prudential tools. However, there is no “one-size-fits-all”
approach to the choice of policy instruments to manage capital flows, and the appropriate
response needs to reflect country-specific circumstances. If capital inflows raise macro- and
financial-stability concerns, macroeconomic policies (e.g., adjusting the fiscal-monetary policy
mix, exchange rate appreciation, and some accumulation of reserves) may need to be
complemented with strengthened prudential measures (e.g., loan to value ratios, funding
composition restrictions). Temporary capital controls can also be used in some cases, but they
should not be a substitute for the necessary macroeconomic and prudential policies.
