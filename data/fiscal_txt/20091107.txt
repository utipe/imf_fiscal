Executive Summary
The global economy has returned to positive growth following dramatic declines. The
recovery is, however, uneven and not yet self-sustaining, notably in advanced economies.
Financial conditions have continued to improve, but are still far from normal.
Going forward, the global economic recovery is expected to be sluggish and inflation will
remain low. The most pressing policy challenges over the near term include maintaining
economic recovery momentum and, for emerging economies, dealing with capital inflows.
Principles for Policy Exit
Exit strategies should pave the way for strong, sustained and balanced economic growth. The
Principles below are intended to establish common ground for the design and implementation
of policies during the exit from the extraordinary support measures taken during the crisis.
Principle 1. The timing of exits should depend on the state of the economy and the financial
system, and should err on the side of further supporting demand and financial repair.
Principle 2. With some exceptions, fiscal consolidation should be a top policy priority.
Monetary policy can adjust more flexibly when normalization is needed.
Principle 3. Fiscal exit strategies should be transparent, comprehensive, and communicated
clearly now, with the goal of lowering public debt to prudent levels within a clearly-specified
timeframe.
Principle 4. Stronger primary balances should be the key driving force of fiscal adjustment,
beginning with actions to ensure that crisis-related fiscal stimulus measures remain
temporary.
Principle 5. Unconventional monetary policy does not necessarily have to be unwound
before conventional monetary policy is tightened.
Principle 6. Economic conditions, the stability of financial markets, and market-based
mechanisms should determine when and how financial policy support is removed.
Principle 7. Making exit policies consistent will improve outcomes for all countries.
Coordination does not necessarily imply synchronization, but lack of policy coordination
could create adverse spillovers.

The global economy has returned to positive growth following dramatic declines. However,
the recovery is uneven and not yet self sustaining, particularly in advanced economies.
Financial conditions have continued to improve, but are still far from normal. Despite recent
momentum, the pace of recovery is likely to be sluggish, since much remains to be done to
restore financial systems to health, while household balance sheet adjustment and bank
deleveraging will be drags on growth. Downside risks have reduced somewhat. A key risk is
that policy support is withdrawn before the recovery can achieve self-sustaining momentum,
and that financial reforms are left to languish.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND RISKS
The global economy is beginning to grow again, but the recovery is uneven and
remains dependent on policy support. Across advanced economies, following sharp
declines in the first quarter of 2009, output increased modestly in the second quarter in some
economies—notably France, Germany, and Japan—and fell at a much more modest pace
elsewhere, including the United States. Emerging

to shift their portfolios into riskier assets, including commodities, high-yield bonds,
and emerging market bonds and equities. Yields on U.S. Treasuries remain relatively
low, reflecting the still-strong demand for risk-free securities among certain investors.


At the same time, however, banking systems remain undercapitalized, suffering from
impaired legacy assets and, increasingly, non-performing loans. Deleveraging
pressures will likely remain a constraint on bank credit for some time. Activity in
securitization markets remains dependent on public sector support. Moreover, large
public interventions have transferred risk to sovereign balance sheets, raising market
concerns that have abated somewhat recently.

The “safe haven” motivations that led to U.S. dollar appreciation through the crisis
have partially unwound, and renewed appetite for risk may be exacerbating shortterm exchange rate movements, particularly against the euro and some emerging
economy currencies. The U.S. dollar has depreciated in recent months as safe-haven flows
have unwound. In real effective terms, it has moved closer to medium-run equilibrium
(though it still remains on the strong side). The

reserves, and, in some cases, with capital

responses in those economies where there may be a need to tighten—particularly in Asia. In
contrast to the experience of many other emerging economy currencies, the Chinese

Commodity prices have broken out of their recent trading ranges, after rebounding
from their lows earlier in 2009, in part due to U.S. dollar depreciation. Although
financial flows have affected price dynamics, there is little evidence to suggest that these
have had a sustained price impact. Expectations of improving demand, combined with the
effect of the weaker U.S. dollar, have led to the recent resumption of rising commodity
prices. A good part of the recovery now appears to be priced into oil and metal prices, and
substantial spare capacity and high inventories should provide buffers against price surges.
A. Prospects
Going forward, the global economic recovery is expected to be sluggish and inflation
will remain low. Policy support and the turn in the inventory cycle will gradually lose
impetus. At the same time, a sustained rebound in advanced economy private demand is
likely to be held back by limited credit availability, households’ desire to rebuild balance

5
sheets, and rising unemployment. The Fund’s
assessment remains that the recovery will be
gradual, particularly in the advanced economies.
Fall 2009 World Economic Outlook projections
suggest that global activity will contract by around
1 percent in 2009, before expanding by about
3 percent in 2010 (Table 1). Notwithstanding
modest upward revisions to growth and the recent
increase in commodity prices, output gaps will
continue to widen and inflation will remain low.

G-20 economies have pursued wide-ranging policy measures aimed at alleviating the
crisis. This includes a lowering of policy rates to historic lows as well as unconventional
measures aimed at impaired credit markets. A wide range of discretionary fiscal policy
measures—estimated at around 2 percent of GDP in 2009—are also being implemented,
including direct public support to financial and other sectors as well as tax and expenditure
measures. These measures have been broadly effective in alleviating the impact of the
financial crisis and stabilizing financial markets, as discussed in the Surveillance Note
circulated for the G-20 Leaders Summit.1
The most pressing policy challenges over the near term include maintaining economic
recovery momentum and, for emerging economies, dealing with capital inflows.


An overarching risk is that the recovery stalls. Premature exit from accommodative
monetary and fiscal policies could undermine the nascent rebound, as the policyinduced rebound could be mistaken for a strong and durable recovery. Financial
strains could also reemerge if the recovery falters and efforts to restore health to bank
balance sheets are not forcefully implemented. Hence, it would be important for G-20
countries to maintain policy stimulus until there are clear signs of a durable recovery,
notably in private demand, along with sustained efforts to recapitalize banks and
repair balance sheets.



Some emerging economies may need to absorb capital inflows and at the same time
avoid compromising domestic financial and price stability. With interest rates in
advanced economies set to remain low for an extended period, and emerging
economies poised to recover at a faster pace, the recent flow of capital into these
economies may continue. Countries have responded with a range of policies,
including exchange rate appreciation, accumulation of reserves, and unorthodox

6
measures. As capital inflows gain momentum, exchange rate appreciation would help
limit capital inflows by reducing “one-way” bets, and also facilitate a shift toward
domestic consumption that is needed in many emerging economies, notably those
with large external surpluses. In some emerging economies, a tightening of fiscal
policy could also help to manage demand pressures and alleviate the impact on the
exchange rate.
II. PRINCIPLES FOR POLICY EXIT
The overall pace of policy adjustment and removal of financial support will depend on the
strength of recovery in private demand in each country and enduring financial stability. This
suggests that the timing of exits will be country specific, although coordination on some
specific fronts is desirable. For most countries, fiscal consolidation should be a top priority,
with monetary policy able to adjust more flexibly to achieve a desired level of overall
stimulus. The scale of fiscal adjustment required is large to ensure debt sustainability and to
restore room for policy maneuver, particularly in advanced economies. Fiscal reforms that
have long-term effects but that do not affect the economic recovery in the short-term (such as
entitlement reforms) should thus be implemented soon to enhance credibility. Current
differences in monetary policy conditions could give rise to larger capital inflows to
emerging market countries, accentuating the need for policies to encourage rebalancing the
global sources of demand. The principles laid out below are intended to establish common
ground for the design and implementation of policies during the exit from extraordinary
support measures taken during the crisis.
A. General Principles
Exit strategies should pave the way for strong, stable and balanced economic growth.
This needs to be based on price and financial stability, fiscal and debt sustainability, central
bank independence, and structural reforms to enhance growth, including new approaches to
financial regulation and enhanced supervision. The achievement of sustained economic
growth requires that the role of the public sector in the economy, including in the financial
sector, be restored to one that supports private and market based financial intermediation.
Market based principles and pricing also can play a role in reducing the use of support
measures prior to their full removal.

7
Principle 1: The timing of exit from stimulus should depend on the state of the economy
and the financial system, and should err on the side of further supporting demand and
financial repair. Communicating strategies and their contingencies will help anchor
expectations and allay market fears.
Commentary: Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the recovery of economic activity and
the financial sector. Policy stimulus and other critical support measures should be withdrawn
only when there is firm evidence of durable financial stability and a self-sustaining recovery
in private demand. Current conditions do not justify a significant and abrupt withdrawal of
either stimulus or efforts to mend the financial system:


A sustained rebound in private demand is likely to be held back by limited credit
availability, a desire by households to rebuild balance sheets, and unemployment
rising well into 2010, indicating the need for caution. Unemployment continues to
rise in many economies, and financial sectors and confidence are still fragile. The
recent rebound in GDP growth seen in some economies is largely accounted for by
policy support and a turn in the inventory cycle. The inventory cycle may still support
growth this year but would then gradually lose impetus.



Forceful fiscal and monetary stimulus and financial sector support have helped ease
financial stress and played an important role in supporting activity, but may need to
be maintained for some time. One of the key lessons from experiences of similar
crises is that withdrawing policy stimulus too early can be very costly, particularly if
the financial system remains vulnerable and prone to adverse shocks. Further
advancing the process of financial restructuring and balance sheet repair (including
bank recapitalization) remains a priority to achieve a healthy financial system.



Basic principles and plans for the exit and beyond should be established early and
communicated clearly and consistently by policymakers to the public. Markets have
shown signs of concern about uncertainty over future policy paths, suggesting the
need for greater clarity in authorities’ plans. While some degree of ambiguity is
unavoidable, as exit policies will need to be contingent on highly uncertain economic
developments, strong communication strategies will help anchor expectations,
facilitating the achievement of price and financial stability and sustainable growth. To
be credible, exit should be based on conservative growth assumptions.

8
Principle 2: With some exceptions, fiscal consolidation should be a top policy priority;
monetary policy is more easily able to adjust to achieve the desired level of overall
stimulus.
Commentary: Achieving fiscal sustainability will be a complex process and will take longer
than normalizing monetary policy. Monetary policy can respond more quickly to achieve the
desired level of overall stimulus, when fiscal retrenchment begins. The strategy for fiscal
consolidation should be outlined and communicated now. Deficit-reducing and debt
management measures should commence as soon as private demand begins recovering. This
is advisable considering both the relative scales of policy adjustment required and managing
risks to both economic and financial recovery:


For most countries, the risks presented by keeping stimulus in place too long suggest
that adjustment is a key priority. Maintaining fiscal stimulus longer than needed has
obvious and immediate consequences for debt accumulation. In many advanced
economies, monetary policy can afford to remain accommodative for an extended
period, given subdued price pressures. In a number of emerging economies, by
contrast, monetary policy may have to tighten sooner—and might therefore be more
synchronous with or even lead fiscal consolidation—if there are signs of rising
inflation or incipient financial vulnerabilities, including credit booms.



The challenges of placing fiscal policy on a sustainable path—both political and
economic—are greater than for normalizing monetary policy. The scale of fiscal
adjustment required to ensure fiscal sustainability will be large, particularly in
advanced economies. This suggests that fiscal policy changes that have long-term
effects but that do not affect the economic recovery in the short term (such as
entitlement reforms and strengthening fiscal frameworks and institutions) should be
implemented soon to enhance credibility.



For emerging economies that had heavily relied on export-led growth and with
sufficient fiscal space, rebalancing from external to domestic demand may require
additional reforms to reduce precautionary saving, including through further fiscal
efforts and structural reforms to strengthen social safety nets, and pension and
healthcare systems. At the same time, improved corporate governance and financial
development could reduce inefficiently high corporate savings.

9
B. Principles for Fiscal Exit Strategies
Principle 3: Fiscal exit strategies should be transparent, comprehensive, and
communicated clearly now, with the goal of lowering public debt to prudent levels
within a clearly-specified timeframe.
Commentary: A high degree of transparency in fiscal accounts is more important than ever.
Requirements include a comprehensive assessment of fiscal risks, including those arising
from possible additional support to the financial sector, volatility in interest rates, guarantees,
and public-private partnerships. Measures to strengthen the finances and operations of
subnational governments and public enterprises may also be needed in some countries.
The general government balance should be targeted, as deficits and debts of subnational
government institutions have the same macroeconomic and financial solvency effects as
those of central governments. Actions to bolster fiscal frameworks and institutions could
include reforms of budgetary processes, more frequent and comprehensive reporting
requirements, medium-term expenditure frameworks, and fiscal rules.
Targeting an appropriate debt ratio of GDP, taking into account longer-term spending
pressures, would help build public awareness and address market concerns regarding fiscal
sustainability:


Stabilizing debt ratios at their likely post-crisis levels will not be sufficient. This is
especially true for those economies facing rising pressure on public finances from key
entitlement programs and demographic change. High debt ratios would impede fiscal
flexibility and raise interest rates.



The appropriate debt ratio will need to take country-specific characteristics into
account. This includes the composition of the debt (currency and maturity), depth of
domestic financial markets, and diversification of the investor base. For many
advanced economies, targeting a gradual return to a gross debt ratio below 60 percent
(the median level before the crisis) would be appropriate, with reforms of
entitlements, other expenditures, and revenues a prerequisite for attaining that target
and maintaining it over time. Targets for emerging economies will need to take into
account generally lower market tolerance for high public debt.



High debt levels require better debt structures (e.g., longer, well spread-out
maturities). There is also a need to ensure adequate recovery of the value of assets
acquired during the crisis, cover any central bank losses, and manage contingent
liabilities so as to minimize their realization.2

10
Principle 4: Stronger primary balances should be the key driving force of fiscal
adjustment, beginning with actions to ensure that crisis-related fiscal stimulus measures
remain temporary.
Commentary: Temporary measures provided through crisis-related stimulus (comprising the
bulk of support) should be allowed to expire, once the economy has strengthened
sufficiently. However, expiry of stimulus and unwinding of automatic stabilizers alone will
not be sufficient to keep debt ratios from rising.


Stronger fiscal adjustment during “good times” will be needed than in the past.
Utilizing the economic upswing to help consolidate public finances will require
resisting spending and revenue slippages. Any

possible objective is to maintain real primary



Revenue measures should focus on reducing special treatment and combating evasion
and avoidance (which would be less distortionary than raising statutory tax rates). In
the many countries where fiscal adjustment needs to go further, tax increases would
be needed to reduce debt to more manageable levels and to increase policy space.



Protecting the poor and the unemployed is an important goal in itself. The adjustment
is more likely to be sustainable if it is mindful of political economy constraints.
Higher inflation should be eschewed as tool of adjustment. This would be ineffective
in reducing debt and would damage growth and equity in income distribution.

C. Principles for Exiting from Monetary and Financial Sector Support
Principle 5: Unconventional monetary policy does not necessarily have to be unwound
before raising policy rates.
Commentary: Maintaining unconventional monetary policy measures does not necessarily
constrain increases in policy rates. Indeed, policy rates may need to rise before
unconventional monetary policy stimulus is fully withdrawn:


In particular, to the extent that credit markets remain impaired, monetary tightening
may need to be led by a raising of policy rates. This is becoming increasingly relevant
for many emerging economies, notably in Asia, that are already witnessing relatively
vigorous rebounds of activity.



Monetary authorities have instruments to maintain control over interest rate policy.
This includes paying interest on excess reserves, even while central bank balance
sheets continue to provide support to some markets.

Normalizing central bank balance sheets will need to be driven by financial market
developments, and there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to removing unconventional
measures:


Central banks have the necessary tools to reabsorb liquidity. A wide range of
instruments can be used to withdraw excess reserves, including reverse repurchase
operations and issuing central bank paper. Some unconventional central bank
measures can be unwound simply by not renewing them, as financial market
functioning improves.



Unconventional assets acquired as a result of financial interventions should be
transferred gradually to the private sector or to other government agencies. They
should be managed to minimize financial losses and maximize recovery rates. Selling
risky assets associated with credit easing operations in specific markets may be
challenging. Moreover, some assets may need to be held for some time to continue
supporting still vulnerable markets.



There may be scope to reduce central bank holdings of government securities, since
these markets are quite liquid. However, any such transactions will need to take
account of overall macroeconomic conditions, notably threats to economic recovery
or price stability.

12
Principle 6: Economic conditions, the stability of financial systems, and market-based
mechanisms should determine when and how financial sector policy support is
removed.
Commentary: International experience suggests uncertainty about the stability of financial
markets persists for some time after systemic financial crises, making it difficult to know in
advance when measures are no longer needed and can be safely removed. The pace of exit
from the financial sector should be so as to avoid market disruptions.


Authorities should retain the flexibility to extend guarantee periods as needed. To the
extent possible, guarantees should carry fees that are risk based. Risks and liabilities
related to guarantees should be gradually transferred to the private sector. To
minimize moral hazard, guarantees should be (re)structured by shifting to partial
coverage, gradually reducing the level of coverage.



Extraordinary depositor protection should be replaced with limited-coverage deposit
insurance in stages, as long as the system remains stable. For credibility, post-crisis
insurance schemes need adequate ex-ante funding.



Public capital injections into financial institutions should be withdrawn in line with
market conditions. Where capital support needs to be maintained until an institution’s
stability is ensured, the government should exercise care to safeguard the public’s
investment in financial institutions and to maintain a level playing field across
institutions.



The removal of financial support measures should be accompanied by steps to
strengthen financial regulatory frameworks and supervision, and clear plans for the
recapitalization of the banking system. The most urgent task of regulation and
supervision during the recovery is to prevent a resumption of risky activities of the
kind that led to the crisis, and to counter increased moral hazard in the financial sector
resulting from public interventions. This will require enhanced capital adequacy
standards, especially for internationally active systemically important financial firms.
Policies to provide incentives for the private recapitalization of banks could include
step-up clauses, long-dated call options for senior management, redemption clauses,
or restrictive dividend policies.

13
D. International Policy Spillovers and Cross-Border Collaboration
Principle 7: Making exit policies credible and consistent, together with communication
and consideration of spillovers, will improve outcomes for all countries. Coordination
does not necessarily imply synchronization, but lack of policy coordination could create
adverse spillovers.
Commentary: A process of regular exchange of information about national exit plans, and
steps to raise awareness of their potential spillover effects, would greatly enhance the
credibility of the exit process. The need to ensure international consistency will vary by
policy area and will be higher among closely-linked economies and financial markets. In
general, the considerable differences across countries in terms of prospects and the need for
further stimulus imply that countries will need to be on different exit paths.


Some specific stabilization measures should be coordinated. In particular,
uncoordinated withdrawal of deposit protection and of other bank guarantees or other
financial sector support measures could have unintended consequences and
distortions, given the cross-border nature of many financial institutions and
transactions. Similarly, international coordination of changes in financial regulations
is necessary to maintain open markets and a level playing field, and to avoid
regulatory and other types of arbitrage. In the area of taxation, tax hikes will be more
effective if designed in cooperation with other countries.



Also, spillovers from differences in monetary policy conditions could pose significant
challenges. Interest rate differentials are already generating capital flows into
economies with higher yields. Such inflows complicate monetary policy
management, requiring difficult choices for authorities: for instance, allowing
exchange rates to appreciate; adopting tighter fiscal policy and lower interest rates
than would be the case without capital inflows; accumulating reserves and sterilizing
flows; or employing controls on capital inflows. In this context, allowing a rapid
appreciation of the real exchange rate would help limit capital inflows by reducing
