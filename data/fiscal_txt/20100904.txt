EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic recovery has advanced despite setbacks to financial recovery. Global growth has been somewhat
stronger than expected during the first half of 2010, but is projected to slow temporarily during the second half of
2010 and the first half of 2011. In advanced economies, recovery remains fragile since employment and household
consumption remain sluggish, although investment is beginning to show some strength. In emerging economies,
activity is fairly broad based, but growth is expected to moderate while remaining robust.
Turbulence in financial markets has receded in recent weeks, but confidence remains fragile. Unprecedented
European policy initiatives have eased concerns about sovereign solvency in the euro area, while market concerns
have prompted the most vulnerable economies to front-load fiscal adjustment and some others to announce or
adopt new consolidation measures.
Downside risks to the recovery have intensified. The combination of sovereign risk and a still weak financial
sector in many advanced economies poses significant risks to the recovery. Renewed turbulence in sovereign debt
markets could precipitate an adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and the financial sector, with spillovers to
the real economy through higher bank funding costs, tighter lending conditions, and retrenchment in capital flows.
An unexpected weakening in activity could unsettle real estate or credit markets more generally, with adverse
consequences for banks with weak balance sheets. Given significant trade and financial linkages, spillovers across
regions could be rapid, with attendant impact on economic recovery.
Sustained, healthy recovery continues to rest on two rebalancing acts—internal rebalancing, led by a
strengthening of private demand in advanced economies; and external rebalancing, reflecting an increase in net
exports in deficit countries and a decrease in net exports in surplus countries, notably emerging Asia.


The two rebalancing acts interact in strong ways. Increases in net exports in advanced countries would bolster
their growth, allowing for more room for fiscal consolidation. Strengthened domestic demand in emerging
market economies would help these countries maintain growth in the face of lower exports.



A number of policies are required to support these rebalancing acts. In advanced economies, the repair and
reform of financial sectors needs to accelerate further to enable a normalization of credit intermediation that
would help support the transition to growth led by private demand. At the same time, these countries need to
put in place now credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. Specific plans to cut budget deficits in the
future need to be legislated soon in order to establish credibility and create room for fiscal policy maneuver.



Fiscal adjustment needs to begin in 2011, even if activity is modestly weaker than presently projected. Fiscal
consolidation remains essential for strong, sustained growth over the medium run. If however, downside risks
materialize and global growth threatens to slow appreciably more than expected, monetary policy should be
the first line of defense, although this line has become thin. Accordingly, countries with fiscal room should
allow automatic stabilizers to play freely; additionally, in these countries some of the planned consolidation
for 2011 may also need to be put on hold, temporarily. At the same time, key emerging economies will need
to further develop domestic sources of growth, supported by greater exchange rate flexibility.

Exits from extraordinary policy measures are proceeding on some fronts but not on others, owing to still
fragile conditions in major advanced economies. Almost all G-20 economies have announced an exit from
crisis-related fiscal stimulus. Exit from monetary policy and financial support remains appropriately on hold in the
major advanced economies, while proceeding gradually in emerging economies. More recently, planned
withdrawal of unconventional support measures has been reversed or slowed in the United States and the euro area,
owing respectively to weak economic data and the recent financial market stresses.

2
I. A GLOBAL RECOVERY WITHSTANDS NEW FINANCIAL SHOCKS
Notwithstanding setbacks to global financial stability, global economic recovery is advancing.
In emerging economies, the growth outlook remains strong, although activity is moderating to
more sustainable levels. Recovery is fragile, however, in the advanced economies, with
prospects for a transition to stronger, privately-led growth still uncertain, notwithstanding
some strength in investment, since unemployment remains high and household consumption is
sluggish. Financial markets and institutions remain vulnerable, although strains have receded
in recent weeks, following unprecedented European policy initiatives that have eased market
concerns about sovereign solvency. Markets remain acutely sensitive, however, to sovereign
risks, prompting vulnerable economies to front-load fiscal adjustment and some others to
articulate additional consolidation measures. The near-term global outlook is subject to
significant downside risks, principally due to the interaction of sovereign risk and a fragile
financial system.
1.
The global recovery has advanced despite setbacks to global financial stability, but
recent developments indicate that the pace of recovery is slowing. In emerging economies,
activity is moderating from an exceptional pace set in the first half of the year. This has helped
support external demand rebalancing. However, internal demand rebalancing in advanced
economies is proceeding only slowly. Investment is beginning to show some strength as policy
stimulus and inventory rebuilding fade, but unemployment remains high and household
consumption sluggish.


Advanced G-20 economies: Recovery is beginning to transition from inventory
rebuilding to investment, but consumption remains weak. In the United States, revised
second quarter estimates indicate a slower pace of recovery than previously assumed.
Despite rebounding capital investment, weak labor and housing markets have been
holding back consumer spending, while inventory accumulation has begun to flatten
and the trade deficit has widened. In Japan, strong fiscal stimulus and demand from
Asian trading partners has helped the recovery. However, domestic demand remains
sluggish, and activity slowed abruptly in the second quarter, remaining appreciably
below pre-crisis levels. Growth in the euro area has strengthened in recent months, in
part reflecting seasonal factors. On the back of robust domestic demand led by private
consumption and investment, the depreciation of the euro from the previous high levels
reached in mid-2008 and healthy foreign demand for capital goods, the second-quarter
has been strong in its largest economy, Germany. The area’s heavy reliance on bank
credit and still-tight lending conditions, however, continue to weigh on demand.



Emerging G-20 economies: Activity in emerging economies has been sustained by
strong domestic demand and the recovery of global trade. Major economies in
emerging Asia—China, India, and Indonesia—remain in the lead, followed by Brazil in
Latin America. In both regions, fixed investment has begun accelerating beyond its
2009 momentum despite less stimulative policies, suggestive of an increasingly selfsustaining recovery. More recently, retail sales and manufacturing activity have begun

3
to moderate from the very elevated levels earlier in the year. The recovery remains
notably more subdued in parts of emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States.

Financial market confidence remains fragile, holding back credit and private
demand, particularly in advanced and a few emerging economies. Despite extraordinary
EU-ECB measures, concerns regarding sovereign and banking sector vulnerabilities persist,
amid increasingly broader concerns about the global recovery.


Spain and Portugal conducted successful
government bond auctions between mid-June
and mid-July with significant demand from
foreign investors, albeit at high yields.
Sovereign bond spreads in the euro periphery
tightened between June and early-August, with
the exception of Greece where they remain
elevated. More recently, spreads have been
widening again in Ireland, Portugal and Spain.

The uneventful liquidity rollover of the ECB’s
expiring one-year long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) in early July bolstered
market confidence, and against the background of low expectations markets have
welcomed the July 23 CEBS stress tests on individual bank capital. European banks
have also benefited from the recent announcement of the Basel regulatory reforms,
which were less strict than anticipated.



After declining 10-15 percent at the height of the turbulence in April-May, equity
markets in advanced economies have recovered substantially in June-August, and
nonfinancial corporate bond issuance has resumed at a strong pace. Short-term funding

4
markets have also recovered, but funding strains remain for second tier borrowers.
Interbank markets remain tiered and recourse to the ECB liquidity facilities is high.
3.
Capital flows to emerging economies have rebounded after falling sharply during
the height of the recent crisis. While this should help external rebalancing, much depends on
how inflows are put to use. After narrowing appreciably over the past year, recent trade data
point again to growing trade surpluses in emerging economies with large surpluses.


Equity markets in emerging Asia, and to a lesser extent in Latin America, have recovered
substantially from losses suffered in April-May. However, stock prices in emerging
Europe, which were hit hardest given strong linkages with core Europe, are yet to make a
comeback. Inflows to emerging market mutual funds, particularly debt funds, have
accelerated, and emerging market external corporate and sovereign issuance has resumed
at a strong pace after almost a complete halt in May. Resurgent inflows to emerging
markets have revived concerns about the potential volatility of inflows and the urgent
need to augment financial stability frameworks to safeguard against sudden stops or asset
price inflation.



Currencies of emerging G-20 economies have continued to appreciate over the first half
of 2010 in both nominal and real effective terms. However, there is notable diversity in
the pace of appreciation, with many Asian

4.
The latest turbulence in financial markets has not derailed the incipient recovery
in private sector credit but markets and banks remain fragile.


Bank lending surveys in the United States and Japan indicate that lending standards
have almost ceased to tighten. Private credit growth in advanced G-20 economies has in
general begun to turn up, except in the United Kingdom and Japan. Credit growth
nevertheless remains low relative to pre-crisis rates, consistent with the historical
behavior of credit following financial crises. While setbacks from the turbulence in
euro area lending have been smaller than feared, the heavy refinancing schedules facing



Among emerging economies, credit growth has
been picking up in most regions. Accelerating
real-estate driven credit growth in parts of
emerging Asia has eased considerably since
earlier this year, following successful
intervention with prudential measures. With the
exception of Turkey, bank credit in emerging
Europe remains weak, with private sector
credit growth still in negative territory.

5.
Unemployment in advanced economies remains high and persistent, slowing down
the recovery of consumption necessary for a durable, private-sector-led recovery.


In most advanced G-20 economies, unemployment rates have receded only modestly
from their peaks. In the euro area, the labor market shows continued resiliency in
Germany, considering the depth of the recession, but has persisted at high levels in
others (e.g., Ireland and Spain). In the United States, unemployment duration is at a
record high and recent payroll data point to a slowdown in employment growth in the
second quarter. Weaknesses in U.S. labor and housing markets have been mutually
reinforcing as high unemployment has fed into higher mortgage delinquencies and
negative housing equity has impeded labor reallocation.



In emerging G-20 economies, unemployment has broadly declined in parallel with
strengthening recoveries, with the notable exception of South Africa where, owing to
structural wage rigidities and weak demand conditions, the unemployment rate exceeds
25 percent.

6.
Commodity prices have stabilized since the financial turbulence, and are expected
to stay broadly unchanged in the near term. After rising through early May, commodity
prices declined and have since remained broadly constant. While demand pressures are
expected to continue to support commodity prices as the global recovery progresses, price
pressures will likely remain moderate and balanced by other forces, including excess capacity
and inventory buffers. Most recently, disappointing harvests in some countries have resulted in
sharply escalating wheat prices. Current market pricing indicates this is anticipated to be a
temporary supply shock, and the spillovers to other food prices have thus far been limited.
Nonetheless, higher wheat prices could pose hardships in some low income countries where
food represents a large fraction of household expenditures.

6
II. PROSPECTS AND RISKS
Prospects
7.
The global recovery has entered a new phase. In advanced economies, support from
fiscal stimulus and inventory rebuilding is diminishing, and growth will be increasingly driven
by consumption and investment. The recovery is projected to continue, with some weakness
from the second half of 2010 likely to carry over into the first half of 2011. Thereafter, higher
investment in equipment in these economies, alongside continued financial healing, is expected
to strengthen employment and consumption. However, risks are to the downside, with high
uncertainty in financial markets of particular concern. Projections are for still-robust growth in
emerging and developing economies, where domestic demand is likely to slow but remain
strong, supporting global growth. However, activity in these economies remains dependent on
demand in advanced economies, particularly in emerging Asia. The modest effects, to date, of
the financial turbulence on commodity prices are not expected to detract significantly from
commodity producers’ relatively solid near-term growth prospects.
8.
Despite some improvements for 2010, the medium-term fiscal outlook in G-20
advanced economies remains challenging, while the fiscal outlook for G-20 emerging
economies is more favorable. Fiscal exit from accommodative policy stances is set to begin in
most advanced and emerging economies in 2011.


In advanced G-20 economies, after deteriorating by about 5 percent of GDP in 2009,
fiscal balances are expected to improve by ¾ percentage points in 2010 compared to
½ percentage point projected in April.1 The improvement also reflects some frontloading of fiscal adjustment in vulnerable euro area economies, tightening measures
announced in the United Kingdom, and a lower projected deficit in the United States.
However, the medium-term fiscal outlook remains challenging. By 2015, the overall
increase in the average gross debt-to-GDP ratios since the beginning of the crisis is still
projected to be nearly 40 percentage points.



The fiscal outlook for emerging G-20 economies is generally more favorable, with debt
ratios expected to decline over the medium term and remain, on average, below 40
percent. The fiscal outlook has generally improved thanks to rebounding activity,
including in some countries with large fiscal deficits (e.g., India). Most countries will
be consolidating in 2011.

1

The overall budget balance improvement in 2010 compared to 2009 stems largely from the decline in financial
sector support in the United States. Without it, the overall balance for the advanced G-20 economies would
worsen by ¼ percentage point of GDP.

9.
Inflation will remain generally subdued, except in some emerging economies. In
advanced economies, continued excess capacity and high unemployment will keep inflationary
pressures muted. With core inflation slowing to less than 1 percent and considerable economic
slack, deflation will be the more pertinent risk. In emerging economies, inflation in 2010 is
projected at 6¼ percent. With commodity prices expected to stabilize, headline inflation is
expected to subside to 5 percent in 2011. However, inflationary pressures will be more
elevated in economies that have had less stable inflation in the past or, such as for example,
India, are operating closer to capacity.

8
Risks
10.
Downside risks to the recovery have risen over the course of the year, as the
momentum of activity has slowed. On the back of weak private sector balance sheets in many
advanced economies and sovereign, financial, and real estate-related risks remaining elevated,
a key risk is that turbulence in sovereign debt markets precipitates an adverse feedback loop
between sovereigns and the financial sector, and spills over to the real economy. Significant
deterioration in sovereign risk could result in spikes in bond yields, tighter lending conditions,
and higher funding costs that interrupt the transitions toward stronger privately-led demand in
advanced economies. A more marked slowdown in advanced economies together with
heightened risk aversion would quickly spill over to emerging and developing economies,
potentially triggering another adverse feedback loop between real and financial sectors.
Against this backdrop, there are two key sources of fiscal risks that could trigger a rapid loss in
market confidence:


Unsuccessful rollovers of maturing debt: Sovereign debt maturing in vulnerable euro
area economies in the second half of 2010 and 2011 exceeds $400 billion. In
refinancing this debt, these countries will face competition from the significant rollover
needs of both other advanced economies (amounting to around $4 trillion) and
European banks, that are also faced with heavy refinancing schedules. Turmoil in
sovereign bond markets, either due to unsuccessful rollovers or capital shortfalls in the
banking sector, could add significant pressure on public finances, trigger a loss of
confidence in markets, and prompt substantial additional fiscal tightening by vulnerable
sovereigns that could undermine the global recovery.



Underperformance in fiscal balances: Market perceptions may be adversely affected if
fiscal balances in 2010 underperform relative to budget plans, owing either to a
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or because of implementation delays.
Even if fiscal outturns are in line with projections, markets may lose confidence in
some sovereigns, if authorities’ efforts in addressing public debt sustainability are
perceived as inadequate or lacking credibility. This could have wider ramifications via
real and macro-financial linkages.

11.
Another risk to the outlook stems from the possibility of renewed weakness in U.S.
property markets. The foreclosure backlog in U.S. property markets is large and growing, in
part due to the recent expiration of the home buyer’s tax credit. When realized, this could
further depress real estate prices. Small and medium-sized U.S. banks, which have significant
real estate exposure, could experience disproportionate losses and hinder bank supply of credit;
labor market conditions may further deteriorate as losses in housing equity restrain mobility;
and the adverse macro-financial linkages could precipitate a loss of market confidence in the
recovery.

9
Medium-term prospects
12.
Medium-term prospects are for subdued growth in advanced economies and
limited external demand rebalancing. As discussed on other occasions, the crisis is likely to
permanently lower output of many advanced economies relative to pre-crisis trends. This view
has been broadly confirmed by the data over the past year, although the extent of output losses
remains very uncertain and dependent on policy choices. At the same time, domestic demand
in key emerging economies is not projected to make up for lower demand in advanced
economies. This partly reflects structural constraints––e.g., the low consumption base in some
countries––and partly rebalancing policies that go in the right direction but need further
strengthening.
III.

POLICY CHALLENGES

Short- and medium-term prospects point to a slow, sluggish recovery that is subject to mainly
downside risks. Policies need to accelerate the rebalancing of demand from public to private
sources in advanced economies and from external deficit to surplus economies. In many
advanced economies, the financial sector remains the Achilles heel of recovery prospects for
private demand. Insufficient progress with repair and reform is weighing on credit, and
slowing the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies, with adverse spillovers on emerging
economies. Accelerated financial sector restructuring and reform should thus be top priorities.
Government budgetary policies are in the process of moving from short-term stimulus to
medium-term consolidation. However, fiscal policies need to urgently deliver measures that
lower deficits over the medium term. This is needed not only to halt and ultimately reverse the
large rise in public debt ratios, but also to help create room for policy maneuver to support
private demand. Additionally, fiscal adjustment needs to be supported with structural reform.
Policies that eliminate distortions to domestic demand in key emerging economies would
strengthen prospects for external demand rebalancing, supporting a more robust recovery in
both emerging and advanced economies.
Fiscal Consolidation
13.
Fiscal adjustment needs to begin in 2011. Fiscal consolidation remains essential for
strong, sustained growth over the medium run. If downside risks to global growth materialize,
threatening to slow growth appreciably more than expected, monetary policy should be the first
line of defense, although this line has become thin. Accordingly, in countries with fiscal room,
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to play freely, and where stabilizers are small,
temporary support, such as extended unemployment benefits or wage subsidies, could be
continued. Additionally, to sustain recovery in these countries some of the consolidation
planned for 2011 might also have to be temporarily postponed.
14.
Policymakers need to specify further measures and begin to deliver on ambitious,
credible and “growth-friendly” medium-term consolidation plans, particularly in key
advanced economies. Plans should emphasize policy measures that reform rapidly growing

10
spending programs—pensions and public health care2—and make permanent reductions to
non-entitlement spending, with a view to improving medium-term conditions for labor supply
and investment. Moderate adjustments, such as increasing the retirement age, may entail no
affect on demand in the short-run. Strengthening fiscal institutions, such as by improving
budgetary processes, better fiscal monitoring, and, in the EU, improving the governance
framework can play important roles in consolidation.
15.
Successful fiscal adjustment will require that consolidation plans are accompanied
by structural reforms. Markets view announced fiscal consolidation plans thus far as
necessary but not sufficient to achieve fiscal sustainability, amid concerns that nominal growth
may be restrained in a disinflationary environment. Indeed, history has shown that fiscal
adjustment is much more effective in the context of high growth.3 It is thus crucial that
adjustment plans be complemented with reforms that raise the trend level of growth. In many
economies facing large fiscal adjustment, structural reforms, particularly in labor and product
markets—such as eliminating dualism and supporting greater competition and lower markups
respectively—can raise potential growth, increase competitiveness, and thereby support longrun fiscal solvency.
Financial Sector Repair and Reform
16.
Recent events in global financial markets underscore the urgent need to accelerate
financial sector repair and reform, and build a robust global financial system. This is
crucial to allow for a solid recovery of private demand as fiscal consolidation proceeds.
Insufficient progress in addressing the legacies of the crisis—bank funding concerns and the
resolution of weak banks—together with regulatory uncertainty has left the system vulnerable.


Regular, rigorous bank stress tests will help resolve uncertainty about bank exposures,
and clarify banks’ abilities to withstand a further deterioration in financial conditions.
Recently conducted EU bank stress tests—which were commended for their
transparency—underscore that greater disclosure of results, along with credible
recapitalization or resolution mechanisms, can provide clarity about counterparty risks
and help bolster market confidence. Additionally, prudential authorities need to more
pro-actively intervene, restructure, or resolve weak banks.



The final agreement on regulatory reforms must deliver a credible and coherent
package of changes—one that will signal both clear intent and announce firm action to
strengthen the global financial system. Recently published analysis led by the BCBS

2

The net present value of future increases in health care and pension spending is more than ten times larger than
the increase in public debt due to the crisis.
3

A one percentage point increase in potential growth—assuming a tax ratio of 40 percent—lowers the debt ratio
by 10 percentage points within 5 years, and by 30 percentage points within 10 years, if the resulting higher
revenues are saved.

11
and the FSB, conducted in close collaboration with the IMF, regarding the
macroeconomic impact, suggests that the proposed Basel reforms to strengthen bank
capital and liquidity requirements would have only a modestly adverse impact on
aggregate output and clear net long term economic benefits. The recent agreement on
revisions to the Basel proposals reduces regulatory uncertainty and clarifies timetables
for implementing regulatory reform. While the new package constitutes a significant
improvement over what was in place prior to the crisis, it also implies a degree of
accommodation, with transition periods that in some cases far exceed the four years
suggested by the macroeconomic impact studies. The deferment of some of the
implementation dates implies that many of the same regulatory inadequacies that were
exposed during the crisis for a longer period will remain in place for now, increasing
the chances of renewed financial instability and placing a higher burden on supervisors
to act as systemic safeguards.


Supra-national sovereign funding backstops should be made demonstrably functional.
This applies particularly to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), upon whose
functioning markets are relying to prevent the spread of sovereign financing risk. Risks
will be mitigated by establishing the EFSF’s financial structure, its credit rating, and the
seniority of its claims relative to other creditors.

External Demand Rebalancing
17.
Emerging economies must augment the financial stability frameworks to
safeguard against uncertainty in volatile financial market conditions. Despite stronger
fundamentals, emerging economies are not immune to downside risks from advanced economy
slowdowns. Upside risks, particularly renewed surges in capital flows, also pose challenges.
The current environment may entail targeted use of macro-prudential tools (such as limits on
foreign-currency loans by banks) to reduce volatility of capital inflows and asset price
pressures, including some use of carefully designed capital controls when other measures are
not sufficient, in combination with macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.
18.
Policies in external surplus economies need to facilitate global demand
rebalancing and pave the way for a sustained, healthy recovery. Progress is being made in
building up domestic sources of activity in these economies. Nonetheless, WEO forecasts
suggest that the external rebalancing that has take place during 2009-10 may be stalling.
Policies to support stronger domestic demand will help maintain activity in emerging
economies the face of lower demand from advanced economies. They will raise net exports of
advanced economies, allowing for a better transition from publicly to privately-led demand,
even if this crucially relies on better fiscal, financial, and structural policies in the advanced
economies.
19.
Policies to facilitate external rebalancing vary across economies. In many surplus
economies, policies could usefully raise productivity in the non-tradable sector. In key
economies, structural reforms need to eliminate distortions underlying structurally high

12
household and corporate savings rates. These reforms can also help raise the quality of growth,
spreading the gains of rising productivity and financial deepening more widely across society.
In some cases, more flexible exchange rates are also needed. The challenges and policies are
complex and a deeper discussion of useful measures and their potential payoffs can be found in
the G20 MAP reports.
IV.

EXITS FROM EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT

The timing, pace, and sequence of exiting from supportive policies will vary by country,
depending on how robust the recovery of private demand as well as financial conditions. In
most G-20 advanced economies, public debt sustainability requires exits from crisis-induced
policies as well as broader adjustments to improve net debt levels. Reflecting market concerns,
vulnerable economies have front-loaded fiscal adjustment. There is increasing divergence in
the monetary policy stances between advanced and emerging economies, reflecting
macroeconomic developments, while financial sector support has been extended in some
European countries.
Fiscal Policy
20.
The timing and pace of fiscal consolidation will vary across the G-20, dictated by
differing country circumstances.


Countries that have come under market pressure and those facing the greatest fiscal
challenges/lacking fiscal room have already started to consolidate and announced
further front-loading (see below). In these countries, strong signals to see these
adjustments through, even if politically difficult, will be critical to prevent adverse
market reaction that forces yet additional front-loaded adjustment. Most other advanced
G-20 economies should start tightening in 2011, and the average adjustment implicit in
current plans appears broadly appropriate.



Fast-growing advanced and emerging economies can, and have in part, already started
tightening policies. In economies with excessive external surpluses and relatively low
public debt, which are principally those in Asia, monetary tightening and exchange rate
adjustment should be the first responders to address demand pressures; withdrawal of
fiscal stimulus can wait. This macroeconomic policy mix would support domesticallybased growth and external rebalancing. In other emerging economies where public debt
is relatively high and external positions broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals, fiscal tightening can start immediately since the recovery is well
underway.

21.
Reflecting financial market pressures, adjustment plans of several vulnerable
European economies have become more front-loaded. Projected changes in the cyclicallyadjusted primary balance due to front-loading are shown in Figure 1. Under these plans, more

13
than three-fourths of the targeted fiscal improvement by 2013 in Greece, Portugal, and Spain
would take place during the current year and 2011.

Fiscal Outlook.

22.
The pace of planned fiscal deficit reductions in several advanced economies is at
least as fast as suggested in the June 2010 Toronto declaration. Advanced G-20 economies
committed to at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016
in the Toronto declaration, implying an annual improvement in headline balances of 1½
percent of GDP. Under national plans, however, targeted average annual improvements in
headline balances are higher at about 1¾ percent of GDP (Table 2). This is largely due to the
more optimistic paths for growth and revenues envisaged in national plans relative to the
Toronto declaration.
23.
Several advanced G-20 economies have recently identified specific measures in
their fiscal consolidation plans. France has announced an intention to raise the statutory
retirement age from 60 to 62 years. In Germany, announced expenditure cuts on social
spending, defense and public sector wages have been complemented by revenue measures,
such as the reduction of some tax exemptions. In Italy, the government has approved, among
other measures, a freeze on public sector pay and measures to combat tax evasion. The U.K.
emergency budget foresees additional expenditure cuts compared to the previous government’s
budget with further details to be provided in the October Spending Review. However, broader

14
plans for reining in entitlement spending, in particular for health care, with a view to ensuring
long-term fiscal sustainability are generally missing.4

Monetary Policy
24.
Monetary policy has remained highly accommodative in many economies. Policy
rates in major advanced economies are exceptionally low, and markets expect them to remain
low for an extended period. A tightening cycle has begun in other advanced economies (e.g.,
Australia, Canada, Korea), but these central banks have signaled caution in further tightening
given increased downside risks to the global economy. In emerging economies, the central
banks of Brazil and India have raised policy rates given the pace of output recoveries, but
others, such as Russia, have maintained rates or even reduced them.
25.
There has been some slowing in the withdrawal of unconventional measures. Central
banks in emerging economies (e.g., Russia) and some advanced economies (e.g., Australia,
Canada and Sweden) have largely unwound liquidity support measures. Most recently, however,
the Federal Reserve has slowed the withdrawal of some unconventional measures in light of weak
economic data.

With important pension reforms having already been enacted in a number of countries, pension spending in the
advanced economies is projected to rise by about 1 percentage point over the next two decades, compared to about
3 percentage points without such reforms. Health care spending is estimated to surge by 3¾ percentage points of
GDP.



The Federal Reserve ended the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (June 30)
in light of improved functioning of asset-backed securities markets. Most recently
(August 10), citing the slower pace of recovery, it announced the decision to reinvest
principal payments on its portfolios of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt
and mortgage-backed securities into longer-term Treasuries.



In the euro area, the ECB terminated the covered bond purchase program as scheduled.
To conduct interventions in the euro area public and private debt securities markets and
to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional, it
launched a new Securities Market Program in response to the recent financial market
strains.

Financial Sector Intervention
26.
Several countries have closed debt guarantee programs to new applicants, but in
many European economies they have been extended. The outstanding usage of
governments’ debt guarantee and recapitalization programs remains substantive in advanced
economies, while demand for these programs has declined and some are being expired.


G-20 countries that have already withdrawn debt guarantee programs include the
United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Korea, Canada, and Australia.



In July 2010, the European Commission approved the extension of debt guarantee
programs from end-June to end-2010 in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland,
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. Guarantee fees have been raised
to discourage banks from relying on state support. In recent months, guarantee
programs have been almost exclusively used by banks with credit ratings of A- or
below or by unrated banks.

27.
Recapitalization programs have been extended in several European economies,
although actual capital injections have declined. With the approval of the European
Commission, Germany, Greece, Portugal, and Spain extended their programs, from end-June
to end-2010.
28.
The expanded coverage of deposit insurance schemes remains in place. Where
either the coverage of deposit insurance has been expanded or a special protection scheme has
been introduced as a temporary measure, the majority of the related measures are not due to
expire until the end of 2011.
