Global Economic Prospects and Policy Challenges
Prepared by Staff of the International Monetary Fund

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUMMARY
The multi-speed recovery continues.


Growth in the first quarter of 2011 was broadly in line with Staff expectations. Activity in most
advanced economies has slowed in the second quarter, but the slowdown is expected to be
temporary.



Overall, the outlook for global growth in 2011–12 remains broadly unchanged compared
with the April 2011 World Economic Outlook, although with considerable differences among
economies.



Growth is expected to remain sluggish in advanced economies faced with household, fiscal,
and financial sector balance sheet problems, but strong in many emerging and developing
economies.

Downside risks have risen.


Concern about debt sustainability and support for adjustment efforts in Europe’s periphery is
leading to increased market worries about potential contagion. Risks from the lack of
credible medium-term fiscal plans are also elevated in other advanced countries, notably the
United States, in which a deadline for raising the debt ceiling looms large, and Japan.



By contrast, overheating pressures in many emerging and developing economies are
intensifying, as exhibited by rising inflation and rapid credit growth.



Low interest rates in major advanced economies continue to push investors into riskier assets
in a search for higher yield, potentially generating financial imbalances, particularly in some
emerging markets.

Policy initiatives are needed to increase robustness and secure the recovery.


The risks of not resolving the Greek crisis are severe. A greater sense of urgency is needed to
address the crisis and reduce the risks of contagion.



Progress on financial sector repair and reform has been too slow, and policy initiatives are
urgently needed to make financial systems resilient to new systemic shocks.



Advanced G-20 economies need to put in place credible medium-term fiscal consolidation
that balances short-run growth fragility with fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy should
support fiscal adjustment and stay accommodative where there is economic slack.



In emerging G-20 economies, more rapid macroeconomic policy tightening and demand
rebalancing is needed in some cases. Pragmatic use of macroprudential tools may be needed
to manage large capital inflows.

Global Outlook and Policy Challenges
Following a solid outturn in the first quarter, there are signs that activity is slowing in the context
of rising downside risks. If there are no major disruptions, growth is expected to continue: weakly
for major advanced economies, and more robustly for a number of emerging economies. But the
vulnerability of the global economy has increased.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE OUTLOOK
The Global Conjuncture—a Solid Start
to 2011, but Signs of a Slowdown
1.
Activity in the first quarter was solid
overall, but with surprises. As projected in the
April 2011 World Economic Outlook, global
growth reached an annualized rate of
4.3 percent, with a recovery in private
demand in advanced economies still
recovering from the damage owing to the
financial crisis. Growth in emerging market
and developing economies evolved as
expected, albeit with considerable variation
across
regions.
Global
employment
continued to pick up, including in many
advanced economies. There were, however,
significant surprises for advanced economies:


The effect of the earthquake and
tsunami on the Japanese economy was
worse than initially expected, because of
disruptions to industrial production and
lower
consumer
confidence
and
spending. Production was affected
directly because of damage from the
earthquake and tsunami; cuts to
electricity delivery; and shortages in key
components, mainly to the electronics
and auto industries.



Growth was also below expectations in
the United States, due to weaker

demand and net exports, after strong
finishes in 2010.


In contrast, growth surprised on the
upside in the euro area, powered by
stronger-than-anticipated investment in
Germany and France.

2.
Signs of a slowdown in the second
quarter. Forward-looking indicators such as
purchasing manager indices (PMIs) and
surveys of consumer confidence suggest that
activity has softened in the second quarter of
2011, especially for many advanced
economies.
Expansion, but at a Slower Rate

3.
New shocks on top of old problems.
Notwithstanding progress toward recovery
from the financial crisis—in particular,

3
households in major advanced economies
have been steadily reducing debt levels and
credit standards are no longer tightening—
the global economy has been hit with new
shocks:




Across the world, higher energy and
food prices have affected disposable
income and inflation expectations are
picking up. Food prices are not high in
real terms; in fact, prices have been at
historically-low levels in recent years, but
the increase of late is still significant. By
contrast, energy prices are high in real
terms and the increase in final prices has
been substantial. Because these are
items that are difficult to do without, the
direct effect is less available income to
support other types of consumption.

Additionally,
concerns
have
been
accentuated by disappointing economic
outcomes elsewhere, leading to asset price
declines:


Results for consumer confidence (U.S.,
Japan, U.K.), employment growth (U.S.),
and housing markets (U.S.) have led to
downward revisions of expectations of
demand growth. 1 Emerging market
equity prices have also been hit by
revised expectations of future policy
tightening, following inflation data.



Risk pricing has increased. In particular,
markets perceive that the prospects of
putting public finances in order in some
advanced economies are worsening. The
lack of progress on banking system
repair, notably in Europe, is a closelyrelated concern. Symptoms include
rising sovereign credit default swap
spreads
in
peripheral
euro-area
economies, credit rating downgrades,
and retreating global equity prices
(especially of banks). Government bond
yields have been driven down by
concerns over low growth, and remain
low in Japan and the U.S. despite
concerns over their fiscal situations.

On the supply side, margins have been
squeezed by rising fuel costs. In addition,
some firms (mainly in automobile and
electronics sectors) have been hit by
uncertainty about supply disruptions
from the Japanese earthquake. These
negative shocks are in addition to the
“old news” of depressed demand in
advanced economies and, in some cases,
uncertainty
about
policies,
which
anecdotal evidence suggests has been
holding back employment and some
types of capital investment (notably
structures).

Financial Markets Remain Volatile
4.
Increased financial market volatility.
Global financial conditions have become
more volatile since late May, after easing
during the previous months of 2011. Markets
are clearly being rattled by developments in
Greece and possible spillover effects.

1

Many commercial institutions have revised down
global growth forecasts for 2011. Staff forecasts were
already lower, but there have been downward revisions
to projections for the U.S. and Japan in 2011.

4
Periphery Debt Concerns Rising

Capital Inflows Volatile, but Rebounding

Capital inflows to Latin American economies
(relative to GDP) continue to be larger than in
emerging Asia and Europe. Across all
emerging economies, the resurgence in
capital inflows since the depths of the
recession is notable for the high share of
portfolio flows, which are generally less
susceptible to world interest rate fluctuations
than bank lending, but less stable than FDI.
Portfolio Inflows Dominant

5.
Capital inflows to emerging economies
remain volatile. Net outflows were seen in
March, associated with elevated global risk
aversion and increased concerns about
inflation in emerging economies and raised
expectations of policy tightening. However,
higher-frequency data suggest that inflows
have resumed.

6.
Progress toward rebalancing global
demand remains limited, with most of the

5
distortions underlying the large pre-crisis
imbalances remaining in place. In particular,
despite some gyrations, bilateral exchange
rates have not moved much in real effective
terms since the April 2011 WEO, and
exchange rates in key emerging surplus
economies remain undervalued.

Commodity Prices Ease, but Demand
Pressures Likely to Resume
7. Commodity prices have declined recently
after substantial rises. This is consistent with
signs of softening global economic activity
and renewed concerns over macroeconomic
and financial risks. Declines were initially
amplified by the unwinding of noncommercial positions, in tandem with
increased financial volatility, but the impact
of financial investors on commodity price
dynamics has been temporary.
8. Rising demand will likely put pressures
on commodity prices again. Despite its recent
decline, the IMF commodity price index
(which includes oil and foods) has risen by
approximately 40 percent since the middle of
2010, with large increases across all major
commodity groups. Moreover, demand
pressures on commodity prices are expected
to reemerge as global activity increases more
rapidly in the second half of the year. The
outlook for commodity prices is therefore
heavily contingent on growth in economies
that are heavy importers of commodities
(such as in east Asia). Based on WEO
projections, the IMF commodity price index is
projected to rise by nearly 30 percent in 2011,
largely due to base effects from the price
surges in late 2010.


Better
weather
conditions
have
improved the outlook for food supply,

but low global inventory levels for many
crops would amplify the price effects of
harvest shortfalls.


Oil price pressures have broadly eased in
recent weeks, including after the recent
announcement by the International
Energy Agency of releases from strategic
oil reserves. Current futures prices for
2011 and 2012 are close to the oil price
baseline (which is based on futures
prices) of $106.30/bbl and $105.25 in
2011 and 2012, respectively. However, oil
inventories and spare capacity have
declined, and geopolitical risks in the
Middle East and North Africa are only
slowly unwinding. For oil prices to be
stable, higher production by OPEC in
2011–12 will be required. Authorities in
Saudi Arabia have committed to
increasing production as needed.

Rising Inflation
9. Global headline inflation has picked up
from 3½ percent in the last quarter of 2010
to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2011, more
than expected. Emerging economies have
seen larger pass-through from commodity
prices to headline and core inflation,
presumably because of higher shares of food
and fuel in consumption. Higher frequency
data indicate that in some advanced
economies, core inflation, although low, has
crept up. However, across advanced
economies, increases in GDP deflators (which
strip out the effects imported goods prices)
thus far remain low, wage inflation is near
zero, and there are few signs that inflation
expectations are unanchored.

6
Core Inflation Still Rising in Emerging
Economies

Low Real Policy Rates in Emerging
Economies

Policies: Still Accommodative Overall
10.
The ECB has raised policy rates, but
monetary policy rates remain close to the
zero bound in the U.S., U.K., and Japan. In the
U.S., the second round of quantitative easing
measures was completed as scheduled in
June. Unconventional monetary policy
initiatives in the U.K. are expected to expire
during the middle of the year. The ECB has
extended the full allotment regime of its
refinancing operations until at least October
2011.

12. In many advanced economies, notably
in Europe and Canada, fiscal adjustment is
well underway. In the United States, the 2011
deficit will be lower than previously forecast
and similar to 2010 in cyclically adjusted
terms, thereby making the planned fiscal
adjustment in 2012 less abrupt. In Japan,
projected deficit/GDP ratios are higher for
both 2011 and 2012, owing to weaker output
growth and revenues this year and greater
reconstruction costs.

11. Across
emerging
market
and
developing
economies,
the
financial
environment remains quite accommodative,
albeit with greater variation across countries.
Policy rates have generally been rising, but,
with some exceptions (e.g. Brazil), from low
levels. On average, real rates are still very
low—in many cases, negative.

13. In
emerging
and
low-income
economies, fiscal deficits and debts are being
reduced gradually. However, cyclicallyadjusted balances are still negative in a
number of economies (e.g. Brazil, India, and
Turkey), even though demand is at or above
capacity.

Outlook: Weak Growth in Most
Advanced Economies, Strong in Most
Emerging Economies
14. All in all, the current slowdown is likely
to be temporary, but growth will remain slow
in advanced economies. Global activity is

expected to slow in the second quarter of
2011 but projected to reaccelerate thereafter.
15. Baseline projections on global growth
and inflation remain broadly unchanged
compared with the April 2011 World
Economic Outlook (Tables 1 and 2).


In advanced economies, growth is
projected to average 2½ percent during
2011–12, decelerating from an average
of about 3 percent in 2010. Growth is
expected to be slightly stronger in the
second half of 2011 than the first half.



Output growth in emerging market and
developing economies is expected at
close to 6½ percent during 2011–12,
compared with about 7½ percent in
2010.

Continued Multi-speed Growth



Several advanced economies have seen a
severe increase in unemployment as a
result of the crisis, despite lower labor
participation rates. Current growth rates
are insufficiently large to make a major
dent in unemployment, and the rise in
long-term unemployment is particularly
worrisome. A notable concern for

across



For 2011, growth is expected to be
weaker than previously projected in the
United
States
and
Japan.
Both
economies are expected to grow more
strongly in 2012.



In the euro area, a relatively stronger
core is pulling ahead of a periphery that
faces daunting challenges, with very high
debt levels, severe competitiveness
problems, and fragile banking systems.
Overall growth in 2011 is expected to be
stronger than previously projected,
although still low. Growth in emerging
Europe is now projected to be higher
than previously expected in 2011,
followed by a softening in 2012, driven
by a sharp domestic demand cycle in
Turkey.



Growth in emerging Asia is expected to
decelerate only slightly from the very
high levels of last year. Exports have

8
slowed as growth in advanced
economies and China has decelerated.
Through April, estimates of disruptions
to regional production networks due to
supply constraints from Japan were
increased substantially, particularly for
the electronics and auto sectors.
However, there are now signs that

production could be back to normal
levels earlier than had been forecast a
month ago.
Latin America will be bolstered by
commodity exports and accommodative
financial conditions, but the pace will
ease in some economies where policies
have been tightening more aggressively.



RISKS
Downside risks have increased again. The fiscal situation in Greece threatens market disorder
that would affect funding rates for other vulnerable sovereigns and could have severe
implications for financial institutions. Political risks are also raising questions about medium
term fiscal adjustment in some advanced G-20 countries, notably the United States and Japan.
Fiscal challenges create severe financial sector risks. The search for yield in a low interest rate
environment is intensifying, and many emerging economies face risks of overheating.

Financial Systems Still Vulnerable
17. Markets are heavily concerned
about developments in and prospects for
Greece. This has serious implications for
the strength of financial systems globally.
In particular, financial systems remain
vulnerable for three key reasons:


In Europe, the total exposure of
banking systems in key economies to
Greece, Ireland and Portugal remains
large. At the same time, despite some
efforts to raise capital (ahead of the
new
round
of
stress
tests)
capitalization of banks in Europe
remains relatively low, compared with
U.S. banks, as measured by core tier 1
capital ratios.



Some banks in peripheral European
countries remain heavily dependent
on the European Central Bank (ECB)

for liquidity support, reflected in high
and rising bond yields.


Banks across the euro area and
elsewhere are lagging behind in
securing funding for 2011. This is
making them vulnerable to a further
tightening in funding conditions,
underscoring the importance for
stepping up the pace at which they
roll over maturing funding, since
rollover needs remain substantial
despite the ongoing deleveraging.

9
Large European Bank Exposures

Relatively Low Capitalization

18. Further shocks could therefore have
significant repercussions. Delays to
implement measures to ensure that
Greece is securely funded would likely
cause market disruption. In the event of a
disorderly sovereign default in the euro
area, risk appetite would likely decrease
sharply, causing unwinding of positions
and elevated funding rates for banks and
vulnerable sovereigns in similar positions
within the euro area, with possible
spillovers for banks and sovereigns in the
rest of the world. Disruptions in wholesale
markets could cause lending standards to
tighten again. Emerging economies could
be vulnerable to sudden reversals in
capital flows. Likewise, an increase in U.S.
Treasury rates could have severe
repercussions for international portfolio
allocations and liquidity in funding
markets.

Fiscal Risks Paramount

Bank Funding is Lagging in Many Cases

19. Fiscal challenges pose significant
risks to the recovery. Fiscal consolidation is
underway in core euro area countries, and
fiscal and structural adjustment programs
in Portugal and Ireland are on track.
However, doubts about the ability to
successfully adjust fiscal policy in Greece
are causing increasingly high spreads to
be demanded by buyers of its sovereign
debt.
20. At the same time, concerns over
medium-term fiscal sustainability are
rising because of the absence of a credible
consolidation and reform plan in the
United States, while in Japan such plans
are not sufficiently ambitious or concrete.

10


In the United States, current debt
dynamics with unchanged policies are
unsustainable. The imperative at the
current conjuncture is to raise the
debt ceiling. Although markets do not
appear overly concerned at this point,
a loss of fiscal credibility would be
extremely damaging, not only for the
U.S., but for the rest of the world,
given the role of the U.S. in world
capital markets. Fiscal adjustment is
now a concern for both political
parties and the administration; this is
per se a positive development.
However, little progress has yet been
seen in breaking the political
stalemate over how to carry out the
needed fiscal consolidation.

Rising Concern over U.S. Debt Ceiling

and Japanese sovereign credit ratings
on negative watch.

Search For Yield
Low interest rates in advanced
economies are generating a “search for

21.

yield”, leading investors to buy riskier
assets and search for new ways of
achieving higher yields. In particular, there
are signs that financial institutions are
again using leverage to generate
sufficiently attractive returns on equity.
Both new and re-financed private equity
transactions
suggest
that
related
corporate balance sheets are quickly
approaching pre-crisis leverage multiples.
Though the aggregate amount of financial
leverage provided remains far less than
before the crisis, high-yield corporate
bond and leveraged loan investors have
recently been borrowing at higher
earnings multiples, not much below 2007
levels. Flows into mutual funds for
emerging market debt have been strong
and EM corporate bond issuance is the
highest in three years.

In Japan, the fiscal response to the
earthquake has added to challenges

Emerging Economies: Risks of
Overheating and Hard Landings

Excessive Credit Growth
Emerging Economies

in

some

22. Indications of overheating in
emerging
market
economies
have
increased. Symptoms include output
running above long-term trends, rising
inflation rates and wage increases,
booming asset prices, high rates of
growth in private sector credit, and
increasing current account deficits.
23. Domestic pressures are associated
in some cases with rapid growth in shortterm capital inflows, notably debt markets.
Although capital deepening is good for
growth, the risk is that too much capital
may be moving too quickly to emerging
markets, with credit standards relaxed,
leading to mispricing of credit and/or
sudden reversals.

24.
Policy makers in some economies
have tightened the monetary stance, but
others have fallen behind the curve. The
longer that policy tightening is delayed,
the greater the risk of a hard landing in
the future.

POLICY CHALLENGES
Policy makers in advanced economies have few options left to buffer the effects of further
negative shocks. Urgent policy action is therefore needed to ensure fiscal sustainability, make
financial systems more resilient to shocks, and put economies on the right path to balanced
and sustainable growth. Emerging economies facing large capital inflows and rapid credit and
demand growth must take their own actions to avoid overheating, asset price busts, or sudden
stops—including more flexible exchange rates and use of macro-prudential measures. To
ensure strong, sustainable and balanced growth, greater progress must be made toward a
rebalancing of global demand
25.
Securing the transition from
recovery to sustained expansion requires
immediate and concerted policy measures.
Most importantly, this should include
providing clarity on euro area-wide
solutions to strains in the periphery, but it
also includes resolving fiscal policy

uncertainty in the U.S. and Japan,
resolving weak banking systems in Europe,
and measures to guard against crashes
and capital flight in emerging economies.

12
Financial Sector Policy: Make the
Financial System robust
26. There is a need to put the global
financial system on a more resilient
footing. The matter is more pressing in
Europe due to sovereign contagion risks.
Though there has been progress on
banking system repair, the pace is too
slow. The pace of recapitalization needs to
be accelerated in order to provide
cushions against asset losses or shocks to
liquidity. Vulnerabilities are currently
masked by unusually accommodative
monetary conditions, but the window of
opportunity to prepare the financial
system against potential systemic shocks
could close unexpectedly.
27. The forthcoming stress tests from
the European Banking Authority will
represent an important opportunity for
updating the assessment of risks in the
European banking system and for
addressing the weak tail of banks flagged
in the April Global Financial Stability
Report. But it is critically important to put
in place and immediately publicize
credible plans to deal with distressed or
non-viable banks, and then be seen to
implement them quickly in the event that
institutions fail the tests or are perceived
to be vulnerable after the tests.
28. Globally, progress on financial
sector regulation has been insufficient,
and existing proposals have been
weakened. In many cases, financial
institutions have already become bigger
and more complex following the crisis. In
addition to larger capital buffers, more
intensive
supervision,
enhanced

transparency and disclosure requirements,
and effective resolution regimes at the
national and global level (including tools
that lead creditors to share losses) are
needed.

Fiscal Policy: Resolve the Sovereign
Crisis and Adopt Credible Mediumterm Frameworks
29. A long-term solution to problems in
peripheral euro area economies requires a
range of measures. In addition to
structural policies and temporary financial
assistance, front-loaded fiscal adjustment
is needed to restore market confidence
and ease the pressure on sovereign and
bank spreads. The weak growth outlook in
Greece and Portugal imply, notably in the
presence of financing constraints, the
need for fiscal adjustment measures, as
agreed in the EC-IMF programs for these
economies.
30.
For Europe as a whole, further
policy measures are needed to address
weaknesses
in
national
budgetary
institutions and procedures that have
undermined past efforts to enforce the
Stability and Growth Pact, such as a lack of
transparency
and
medium-term
orientation, as well as an optimistic bias in
some national official forecasts. Some
reforms to overhaul EU governance have
been proposed. They need to be
legislated and implemented expeditiously.
31. Addressing the fiscal situation in U.S.
and Japan requires balancing short-run
growth
fragility
with
long-term
sustainability concerns. But authorities
should implement credible medium-term

13
fiscal adjustment plans that include
entitlement and revenue-raising tax
reforms. For the United States, it is critical
to immediately raise the debt ceiling.
32. In some emerging markets, the task
is to avoid overheating and prevent the
build-up of financial imbalances. In such
economies—which include Brazil, India
and Turkey—there is room for further
consolidation. This will take pressure off
monetary and prudential policies and
create fiscal space to respond to future
shocks. It would also be beneficial to
reorient spending—notably, to protect
vulnerable sections of society against
commodity price increases. Authorities
should aim to protect the poor and
vulnerable groups through targeted social
safety nets, but avoid policies that seek to
insulate domestic markets from high
world prices (e.g., export bans or
subsidies), which dampens the supply
response and amplifies global price
volatility.

Monetary Policy: Accommodative in
Advanced
Economies;
More
Tightening in Emerging Economies
33. In most advanced economies,
monetary
policy
should
stay
accommodative. Given excess capacity,
recent signs that growth has slowed, and
planned fiscal consolidation, current
monetary policy accommodation should
remain as long as medium-term inflation
expectations remain well-anchored.
34. A number of emerging market
economies are already operating at or
above capacity. There monetary policy

tightening is needed, along with greater
exchange rate flexibility and the use of
macroprudential tools. While many
emerging
market
and
developing
economies are already raising policy rates,
real rates still remain low or even negative.
Thus, policy tightening will have to
continue.


Dealing with commodity price rises
poses
a
particular
challenge.
Monetary authorities need to prevent
such rises from generating successive
wage-price increases. Authorities can
afford to be more accommodative in
those economies where the credibility
of monetary policy is high. However,
where shares of food and energy in
consumption are high and policy
credibility is low, as is more common,
authorities will have to react faster
and more strongly.



In an environment of low interest
rates in advanced economies, raising
domestic interest rates might attract
capital inflows. The correct policy
response is not to avoid raising rates,
but
to
implement
sound
macroeconomic
policies,
which
includes allowing the exchange rate
to appreciate when it is not
overvalued, and to flexibly employ
macroprudential
and
regulatory
policy tools to deter hot flows and
guard against misallocation of capital.

14
Structural Policies and Supervision:
Lay the Foundations for Stable
Growth

should be complemented with progress
toward a unified European financial
supervisory and stability framework.

35. Structural reform measures are
needed in many advanced and emerging
economies—including
economies
in
Europe, the United States, Japan, and
China—to anchor strong, sustainable and
balanced growth.

Collective Action is Needed
Reduce Global Imbalances.

36. In the euro area periphery, there is
no way around ambitious structural
reforms to boost competitiveness and
revive employment growth. Such reforms
should address labor markets (such as
education, to reduce mismatches) and low
productivity (through infrastructure and
research). Privatization will contribute to
these objectives beyond helping to
establish debt sustainability.
37.
More economic and financial
integration is essential for a dynamic and
stable EMU. The integration of labor,
goods, and services markets must
continue, and obstacles the free flow of
equity capital must be eliminated. This

to

38.
Greater progress in advancing
global demand rebalancing is essential to
put the recovery on a stronger footing
and ensure strong, sustainable and
balanced growth.


Many of the distortions underlying the
large pre-crisis imbalances remain in
place, including high saving and
undervalued exchange rates in key
surplus economies and insufficient
saving in advanced deficit economies.



The broad contours of policy actions
aimed at reducing global imbalances
were well received at the G20 meeting
in Seoul in November 2010, but
implementation has been slow.



Collective action aimed at eliminating
policy distortions remains essential for
anchoring G-20 growth objectives.
