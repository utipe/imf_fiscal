EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery is fragile and uneven, with financial sector strains having receded somewhat, but
markets remaining acutely sensitive to sovereign and banking sector risks. Global growth was stronger than
expected during the first half of 2010, but is projected to slow during the second half of 2010 and the first half of
2011.


In advanced G-20 economies, the recovery is beginning to gradually transition from being driven by
policy-related stimulus and inventory rebuilding to investment, but private consumption remains sluggish.



Activity in emerging G-20 economies has been led by a recovery in domestic demand and the rebound in
global trade, but has recently begun to moderate to more sustainable levels.

Downside risks to economic recovery remain large. Further strains in the U.S. housing market, the lack of
credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, risks of spillovers from turbulence in sovereign debt markets,
risks of overheating and asset price bubbles in emerging economies owing to large capital inflows, and fears of
financial and trade protectionism and currency instability continue to weigh on economic recovery.
Rebalancing of global demand remains the lynchpin for securing strong, sustainable, and balanced
growth. This involves internal rebalancing in advanced economies, anchored by a shift from public- to privatedemand-led growth, and external rebalancing, underpinned by an increase in net exports in advanced deficit
countries and a decrease in net exports in emerging surplus economies.


External and internal rebalancing interact in important ways—increases in net exports in advanced
countries would bolster growth, allowing greater scope for fiscal consolidation, while strengthened
domestic demand in emerging economies would help support growth in the face of lower exports.



Currently, internal rebalancing remains sluggish in major advanced G-20 economies. External imbalances,
after declining during the crisis, are projected to not narrow any further over the medium term. Many of
the distortions underlying large pre-crisis imbalances—including undervalued exchange rates in key
emerging economies and insufficient domestic saving in advanced deficit economies—remain.

While continuing to support recovery, policy priorities across G-20 countries should increasingly focus on
medium-term requirements, aimed at rebalancing global demand.


Advanced economies must expeditiously repair and reform financial sectors, to normalize credit conditions
and support internal rebalancing. This would help reduce the need for the highly accommodative monetary
policy stance in these economies, which is contributing to large capital inflows to emerging economies.



Advanced economies should also put in place and begin implementing credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation plans to anchor confidence, crowd-in private demand, and create room for fiscal policy
maneuver. As part of these plans, consolidation should begin in 2011. If global growth risked to slow
appreciably more than expected, countries with fiscal room could postpone the planned consolidation, and
all but the most vulnerable economies should allow automatic stabilizers to operate freely.



In key emerging surplus economies, exchange rate appreciation should begin in earnest, accompanied by
an acceleration of reforms aimed at boosting domestic demand—in the absence of policies targeting the
elimination of underlying distortions, global imbalances will continue to widen, threatening growth
prospects in both advanced and emerging economies.

2
Global Economic Prospects and Policy Challenges1
The global economic recovery continues to advance, but remains uneven and fragile, with
downside risks remaining elevated. Financial sector strains have receded recently, but markets
and institutions remain sensitive to sovereign and banking sector risks. Global growth has been
somewhat stronger than expected during the first half of 2010, but is projected to slow during the
second half of 2010 and the first half of 2011. Policy priorities in the G-20 should continue to
support recovery, but must focus increasingly on rebalancing global demand, which is critical
for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.
I. MODEST REBALANCING OF GLOBAL DEMAND
Recovery and growth prospects depend on two rebalancing acts. Internal rebalancing, involving
a shift from public- to private-demand-led growth, and external rebalancing, underpinned by an
increase in net exports in advanced deficit countries and a decrease in net exports in emerging
surplus economies. Progress on global demand rebalancing remains slow and sluggish.
1.
In advanced G-20 economies, internal rebalancing is advancing, albeit slowly. In
particular, recovery is beginning to transition gradually from being driven by policy-related
stimulus and inventory rebuilding to investment, but private consumption remains sluggish.
Unemployment remains high in several advanced economies, which, coupled with large excess
capacity and well-anchored inflation expectations, has reduced inflation to low, albeit thus far
stable, levels. In the context of a tepid recovery and limited room for further fiscal support, a
number of major advanced economies continue to maintain an accommodative monetary policy
stance, including through an expansion of central bank
balance sheets.
U.S. Real GDP Growth Contributions


In the United States, growth slowed markedly in
the second quarter on the back of an unexpected
surge in imports and leading indicators point to
continuing weakness in the near term. Capital
investment has shown some signs of strength,
but this has not been accompanied by a robust
and sustained recovery in employment and
private consumption, owing in part to
continuing repair of household balance sheets.



In Japan, fiscal stimulus and intra-regional trade have boosted growth since late last year,
but private demand continues to be sluggish and activity has slowed more recently and
remains appreciably below pre-crisis levels.



In contrast, activity in the euro area showed significant strength in the second quarter, led
by strong growth in Germany. However, weaker trading partner growth, lingering
difficulties in the financial system, and high unemployment rates are expected to weigh
on growth.

2.
In emerging G-20 economies, robust activity has been sustained by a recovery in
private demand and the rebound in global trade. Reflecting the relative strength of economic
activity, unemployment has declined in these economies (with a few exceptions, such as South
Africa), while inflation is generally higher, although some moderation is expected as commodity
prices stabilize.2 Medium-term prospects, however, remain linked to developments in advanced
economies.


Growth in emerging Asia and Latin America is beginning to moderate, but activity
remains robust. In both regions, private fixed investment, employment, and consumption
have expanded vigorously as the temporary effects of the inventory rebuilding and policy
stimulus wane, hinting at an increasingly self-sustaining recovery. The recovery is more
subdued in other emerging economies, particularly in parts of emerging Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States.

3.
Internal rebalancing in advanced economies has been hampered by financial sector
uncertainty, with financial markets, notably in Europe, remaining particularly wary of
spillovers from sovereign debt markets to bank balance sheets. Moreover, insufficient
progress on financial sector repair and reform in advanced economies has impeded the
normalization of credit, raising the burden on monetary policy to support activity, contributing to
large capital flows into emerging economies.


2

In advanced economies, turbulence in financial markets earlier this year has receded but
not entirely dissipated, notwithstanding large-scale intervention by central banks. The
situation remains stressed, partly owing to the costs of banking sector problems
(particularly in Ireland), continuing concerns about debt sustainability and
competitiveness (Portugal and Greece), and more broadly from worries about recovery
prospects in the major economies.

Commodity prices have lost some of the strong gains realized during the initial phase of the recovery and are
expected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term. More recently, disappointing harvests in key countries have
resulted in sharply escalating wheat prices. Current market pricing, however, suggests that this is a temporary shock,
with spillovers to other food prices expected to be limited. Nonetheless, higher wheat prices could yet have adverse
effects in some low income countries, where food represents a large fraction of household expenditures.

4


Financial sector uncertainty continues to be a drag on private demand, notwithstanding a
tepid and incipient recovery in private sector credit. Bank lending surveys in the major
economies show that lending standards have just about ceased to tighten, but credit
availability remains modest, with growth rates remaining well below pre-crisis levels.
Moreover, the heavy refinancing schedules facing European banks and the exposure to
real estate among some U.S. banks represent important risks to the continued
normalization of credit conditions, especially given the possibility of larger backlogs in
foreclosures due to signs of widespread irregularities in documentation.



In emerging economies, capital inflows are driving down yields and boosting financial
activity, especially in countries with open capital accounts. Credit growth has been
picking up in most regions. Real-estate-driven credit growth in parts of emerging Asia
has eased considerably since earlier this year, following successful intervention with
macro-prudential measures.

Fiscal consolidation efforts across
individual G-20 countries reflect the balance
between the continued need for supporting
recovery, because of an insufficient pick-up in
private demand, and making a credible start
towards strengthening public finance. Overall,
notwithstanding some improvements for 2010, the
medium-term fiscal outlook in G-20 advanced
economies remains challenging, while the fiscal
outlook for G-20 emerging economies is more
favorable.

relative to 2010. The improvement reflects some front-loading of fiscal adjustment in
vulnerable euro area economies, tightening measures in the United Kingdom, and a lower
projected deficit in the United States. By 2015, the overall increase in the average gross
debt-to-GDP ratios since the beginning of the crisis is still projected to be nearly
40 percentage points.


The fiscal outlook for emerging G-20 economies is generally more favorable, with debt
ratios expected to decline over the medium term and remain, on average, below
40 percent. The fiscal outlook has generally improved owing to rebounding activity,
including in some countries with large fiscal deficits. There are some differences in fiscal
positions across these economies, and countries with better positions do not need to
undertake much tightening. Nevertheless, most countries are planning to consolidate in
2011.

5.
External rebalancing in the G-20 remains modest, with global imbalances, after
declining with the collapse in global trade during the crisis, not expected to narrow over the
medium term. Dynamics of current account balances within the G-20 are expected to change.
Surpluses of oil-exporting countries are expected to narrow, while balances of other emerging
surplus and advanced deficit economies are expected to widen further. Many of the distortions
underlying large pre-crisis imbalances—including undervalued exchange rates in key emerging
surplus economies and insufficient domestic saving in advanced deficit economies—remain.
Without policies targeted at correcting these underlying distortions, global imbalances will not
narrow on a durable basis, and risk undermining global growth prospects and fiscal
sustainability.

Capital flows to emerging economies have recovered strongly following the recent
turmoil in financial markets, but have not helped catalyze a rebalancing of global demand.
In the context of accommodative monetary policies in major advanced G-20 economies, a search

6
for yield along with stronger growth prospects have resulted in large capital flows to emerging
economies, notably those with open capital accounts.


Some countries, such as Brazil, have received
particularly large volumes of capital inflows—
this reflects yield differentials, the desire of
real money investors to secure greater exposure
to major emerging economies (notably the
BRICs), and the relatively closed capital
accounts of other countries, such as China.

exchange rate appreciation. The policy
response to capital inflows in key emerging surplus economies, notably in Asia, has been
to intervene in foreign exchange markets to accumulate reserves and limit currency
appreciation, contributing to continuing significant exchange rate misalignments relative
to fundamentals—for instance, the Chinese reminbi remains substantially
undervalued.3At the same time, some other emerging economies, notably South Africa
and countries in Latin America, have allowed their currencies to appreciate substantially
in nominal effective terms, boosting real-effective exhange rates to levels that are looking
increasingly overvalued. The significant cross-country differences in the extent of de
facto exchange rate flexibility and the limited scope for policy responses in countries
receiving large inflows is stirring some tension across G-20 members.



The real effective exchange rates of Japan, the euro area, and the U.K. all appear broadly
in line with medium-term fundamentals, while the U.S. dollar is on the strong side of
fundamentals. While advanced economies have generally avoided intervening in currency
markets, some have intervened more recently to limit rapid appreciations, contributing to
the above-mentioned tension on this issue.

3

In the case of undervalued exchange rates in rapidly growing emerging economies, relatively strong cyclical
positions would reinforce the case for real appreciation.

II. PROSPECTS AND RISKS
7.
The global recovery has entered a new phase. Growth has moderated owing to a
weakening of public demand even as private demand remains sluggish in the advanced
economies, while external rebalancing continues to provide limited impetus.




Growth in advanced economies is expected to
remain subdued in the near term. In the second
half of 2010 and first half of 2011, the most
likely prospect is of continued but more
moderate, multi-speed recovery, as the
inventory-led rebound gradually slows, the
impact of accommodative fiscal policies fades,
and high uncertainties in financial markets
continue to weigh on activity. Thereafter,
continued financial healing is expected to
strengthen employment and private demand.

1/ Dashed lines denote April 2010 WEO forecasts.

Projections are for still-robust growth in
emerging and developing economies, where domestic demand will remain strong—albeit
at moderating levels—carrying growth as demand from advanced economies slows.
However, activity in these economies, particularly in emerging Asia, remains linked to
demand in advanced economies. The modest effects, so far, of the financial turbulence on
commodity prices are not expected to detract significantly from commodity producers’
relatively solid near-term growth prospects.

8
8.

Downside risks to the recovery remain elevated. Key downside risks include:



Renewed pressures in the U.S. housing market: The foreclosure backlog in U.S. property
markets is large and growing, and could contribute to further decline in real estate prices,
compounding the debt overhang problems of households. Some U.S. banks still have
significant real estate exposure. They could experience disproportionate losses and hinder
bank supply of credit and, through macro-financial linkages, hamper market confidence
and the global recovery.



Spillovers from renewed turbulence in sovereign debt markets, notably in Europe: A key
risk is that turbulence in sovereign debt markets precipitates an adverse feedback loop
with the financial sector, and spills over to the real economy and across regions through
higher funding costs, tighter lending conditions, and retrenchment in capital flows.
Turmoil in sovereign bond markets could also be initiated by new capital shortfalls in the
banking sector, which would add further pressure on public finances and trigger renewed
loss of market confidence.4



The lack of credible medium-term consolidation plans. If major advanced economies
delay announcing credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, underpinned by
conservative growth assumptions and concrete policies and measures, there is a risk that
confidence will be undermined and bear upon recovery prospects. This could have wider
ramifications through real and macro-financial linkages.5



Capital flows and risks of overheating in emerging economies. Large capital inflows into
major emerging economies, coupled with insufficient policy levers in some, pose risks of
overheating and asset price booms, with attendant spillovers, and could undermine
sustainable recovery.



Financial and trade protectionism and currency instability: A recent wave of foreignexchange interventions to limit appreciation in some emerging and advanced economies,
predominantly in Asia and Latin America, has raised the specter of protectionism, which
could derail the global recovery. This has reinforced the need for more a collaborative
approach to put the global recovery on a stronger footing.

4

A significant amount of sovereign debt is also maturing in vulnerable euro area economies in the remainder of
2010 and in 2011, and these countries will face competition in refinancing this debt from the significant rollover
needs of other advanced economies and banks. Financial sector disruptions could still trigger a loss of market
confidence that could undermine the global recovery.
5

Important issues that still need to be addressed are: the need to specify concrete measures that would allow the
attainment of the announced deficit targets; the need to start delivering on the medium-term plans in countries that
have already adjusted in 2010; the need to commit to concrete long-term debt targets; and the need for plans to
tackle medium-term spending pressures, particularly health care.

9
III. POLICY CHALLENGES
Collaborative policies that support a rebalancing of global demand are crucial to secure strong,
sustainable, and balanced growth. In advanced economies, two key policy priorities—financial
sector reform and credible medium-term fiscal consolidation—are central to catalyzing a pickup in private demand. External rebalancing will require reforms aimed at boosting domestic
demand in emerging surplus economies, notably through greater exchange rate flexibility.
Policy Priorities in Advanced Economies
9.
The financial sector remains the Achilles’ heel of recovery prospects for private
demand. In many advanced economies, insufficient progress with repair and reform is weighing
on credit growth, and slowing the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies, with adverse
spillovers on emerging economies, through large and volatile capital flows. Accelerated financial
sector restructuring and reform should thus be top priorities. Moving expeditiously to address the
legacies of the crisis—including bank funding concerns, the resolution of weak banks, and the
restructuring of balance sheets for distressed households—as well as to alleviate regulatory
uncertainty will strengthen financial systems and help catalyze rapid private-demand-led growth.
10.
Fiscal policies must increasingly address medium-term requirements to enable debt
sustainability. A key priority is for policymakers to further specify and begin implementing
medium-term consolidation plans to help achieve sustainable fiscal positions. Successful fiscal
adjustment will require that medium-term consolidation plans are accompanied by structural
reforms that raise the trend level of growth and thus support long-term fiscal solvency.


Fiscal consolidation in advanced economies should begin in 2011, but the type and speed
of adjustment should reflect different circumstances in different countries, especially in
terms of the pace of recovery and risks to fiscal credibility. On the whole, country
consolidation plans for 2011 strike an appropriate balance between making a credible
start toward strengthening public finances and continuing to support the recovery.



If growth risks to slow appreciably more than expected, some of the planned
consolidation could be slowed or postponed in countries with more fiscal room.
Monetary policy must remain the first line of defense, although this line is becoming
increasingly thin in most advanced economies. In all but the most vulnerable countries,
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully and, where stabilizers are small,
temporary support (such as extended unemployment benefits or wage subsidies) could be
continued.



Medium-term consolidation plans should emphasize policy measures that reform rapidly
growing spending programs—such as pensions and public health care—and make
permanent reductions to non-entitlement spending, with a view to improving labor supply
and investment. Moderate adjustments to current policies, such as increasing the
retirement age, may entail no effect on demand in the short-run but can have large

10
beneficial effects on fiscal sustainability. Strengthening fiscal institutions, through
improved budgetary processes, better fiscal monitoring, and, in the EU, improved
governance frameworks, can play important roles in consolidation. Credible mediumterm consolidation in advanced economies may allow more fiscal room, alleviating the
need for accommodative monetary policy and reducing large and potentially unstable
flows to emerging economies.
11.
Given a fragile recovery, an accommodative monetary policy stance remains
appropriate in advanced economies, but negative spillovers to other economies, in
particular emerging economies, need to be closely watched and managed carefully. In
particular, maintaining accommodative monetary policy through 2011, including through an
expansion of central bank balance sheets, can counteract some of the contractionary effects of
fiscal consolidation. At the same time, however, policymakers should be mindful of the impact
of such action on other economies, notably through large and volatile capital flows. A key to
addressing this challenge is to expeditiously reform and repair financial sectors in the major
advanced economies, which would both help catalyze a sustained private demand-led recovery in
these economies, allow for interest rates increases and limit spillovers to emerging economies.
12.
Fiscal adjustment will be easier if consolidation plans are accompanied by
structural reforms. History has shown that fiscal adjustment is more effective in the context of
high growth. It is thus crucial that adjustment plans be complemented with reforms that raise the
trend level of growth. In many economies facing large fiscal adjustment, structural reforms,
particularly in labor and product markets—such as eliminating dualism and supporting greater
competition and lower markups, respectively—can raise potential growth, increase
competitiveness, and thereby support long-run fiscal solvency.
Policy Priorities in Emerging G-20 Economies
13.
Given strong trade and financial links, external rebalancing is in the best interest of
emerging surplus economies. As many of these countries gain weight in the global economy,
strategies to promote export-led growth will become less viable from a multilateral viewpoint,
and eventually cause tensions as countries compete for a share of global demand. A reallocation
of demand away from the external sector may initially be painful for some sectors in these
economies, but will lead to sizeable gains over the medium term by raising overall living
standards and ensuring sustainable and balanced growth. External rebalancing will require
exchange rate adjustments, and significant appreciation of many emerging market currencies.
Market forces are already facilitating external rebalancing in many emerging surplus countries,
with large capital flows putting pressure on exchange rates to appreciate.
Many emerging economies are faced with a difficult policy challenge of managing
14.
large capital inflows. Capital flows should be viewed as an opportunity to start down the path of
correcting global imbalances, not as a hindrance. That said, managing large inflows will be a

11
challenge, and the task becomes more onerous in the context of limited exchange rate flexibility
in some major emerging economies.
15.
Policy responses to capital inflows need to be tailored to individual country
circumstances. The appropriate response will need to be based on whether capital flows are
assessed to be permanent or transitory, the exchange rate is fairly valued, reserves are adequate
and if there are risks of overheating (see figure below).


Assessing whether capital inflows are permanent or transitory is not an easy task, and
will involve some judgment. To the extent that they are assessed to be permanent, which
appears to be the case in the current context—reflecting economic fundamentals in the
recipient country and structural shifts in investor portfolio preferences—they should be
accommodated. In most cases, a response centering only on accumulating reserves will
delay and worsen the required adjustment. However, if capital flows are assessed to be
driven by more transitory factors, an accumulation of reserves, as well as macroprudential and capital control measures could be considered.



In cyclically-advanced emerging G-20 economies, such as Brazil and India, where
reserves are adequate and exchange rates have been flexible, fiscal tightening will help
manage capital inflows. In Brazil, this would also help reduce the burden of adjustment
on monetary policy and facilitate convergence towards lower real interest rates, thereby
reducing the incentives for short-term capital inflows. If these measures are insufficient,
the policy response may also have to include some combination of further appreciation,
accumulation of reserves, macro-prudential measures (such as limits on foreign-currency
loans by banks), and carefully designed capital controls.6



In other cyclically-advanced economies, notably in Asia (such as Korea and Indonesia),
where reserves are adequate, the exchange rate is not overvalued, and there are currently
no overheating pressures, the best first line of defense in response to large capital inflows
remains a freely floating exchange rate, which will help to avoid expectations of one-way
bets that may be contributing to large carry trades. The government’s recent introduction
of a package of foreign-currency-related measures may help limit speculative inflows.



Policies to enhance the capacity of local markets to absorb capital flows will also pay
dividends—India, for instance, has allowed greater foreign access to its domestic bond
market. Better allocation of capital (both domestic and foreign) and harnessing more
long-term, stable capital inflows, will require making long-term investment into emerging
economies more attractive—for example, by lowering restrictions on foreign direct
investment, promoting private-public partnerships for much needed infrastructure

undervalued, and reserves are judged to be inadequate. "Lower rates / Rebalance policy mix" refers to loosening
monetary policy; to the extent that fiscal policy is tightened, there would be more room to lower policy rates.

IV. CONCLUSION
16.
There is an urgent need for multilateral policy coordination and agreement on key
issues related to rebalancing and exchange rates. Based on the G-20 mutual assessment
process (MAP), it is evident that G-20 policies make progress toward achieving strong,
sustainable, and balanced growth, but more is required to attain the objectives agreed by Leaders.
Collaborative action across the G-20 with appropriate timing and sequencing of policies—
reflecting inter alia the strength of recovery—will produce benefits. In particular, significant
upside potential can be realized through strengthened joint policy action, as elaborated in the
Fund staff report on the MAP. In terms of policy risks, a breakdown in cooperative action could
inflict substantial welfare costs to the G-20.
17.
A non-cooperative policy scenario involving firm resistance to currency
appreciation in emerging surplus economies and the lack of expeditious repair and reform
of the financial sector in major advanced economies, could be damaging.

13


Policy efforts to preclude the helpful exchange rate adjustment needed for global
rebalancing could be damaging on several levels. For surplus economies that exhibit
symptoms of domestic overheating and facing capital inflows, efforts to firmly resist
currency appreciation could exacerbate overheating pressures or capital account pressures
through expectations. This could lead to booms (and busts) in asset prices, growth, and
inflation. Moreover, the threat from rising trade protectionism would be serious given the
tendency for non-cooperative policy actions to be met with non-cooperative policy
responses (i.e., retaliation). Higher barriers to international trade would dampen growth
and have adverse welfare implications for all G-20 members, particularly those that are
more dependent on trade. At the same time, low growth in advanced deficit economies,
will make it difficult for these countries to put in place credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation plans, needed to anchor market confidence and underpin sustainability.



Similarly, if financial sector repair and reform does not proceed in earnest and rapidly
across major advanced G-20 economies, it will seriously slow the normalization of
monetary and fiscal policies in these countries and continue to fuel rapid capital flows to
emerging economies and perpetuate the risks identified above. Advanced economies need
to collaborate further to address the legacies of the crisis on a durable basis, to inter alia
strengthen financial systems and help catalyze the much needed internal rebalancing

18.
By significantly reducing downside risk, collaborative action will increase the
effectiveness of policies in key areas and avoid significant welfare costs to the G-20
members associated with fragmented or “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies.

1/ G-20 consists of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, euro area, EU other, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States; EU other consists of European Union countries excluding
euro area and U.K.
2/ For the analysis of global imbalances, the euro area is treated as a whole given its common monetary and exchange rate policies.
Accordingly, the advanced surplus economies in that case comprise Canada, euro area, Japan, and Korea, and advanced deficit
economies include Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Emerging surplus countries consists of Argentina, China,
and Indonesia, major oil exporters includes Russia and Saudi Arabia, and emerging deficit countries comprises Brazil, India, Mexico,
South Africa, Turkey, and other EU.
