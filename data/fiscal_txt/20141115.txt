EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
An uneven and brittle global recovery continues, despite setbacks this year. With world growth in
2014H1 worse than expected in the spring, global growth forecasts have been lowered to 3.3 percent for 2014
and to 3.8 percent in 2015. Supportive financial conditions, moderating fiscal consolidation, and strengthening
balance sheets should sustain the recovery in the remainder of 2014 and into 2015. Overall, slow growth
highlights the importance of G20 commitments to raise global growth.
Key developments since the October WEO include a financial market correction, appreciably lower oil
prices, and some further signs of weakness in activity. Sovereign bond yields in advanced economies,
which had fallen since the spring, declined further in October. Equity prices, which trended up till lateSeptember, have declined since, notably in emerging economies, where risk spreads have increased. The
recent increase in financial market volatility is a reminder of potential risks and potential further corrections.
While it is too early to identify the supply and demand factors at play, all else equal, the recent appreciable fall
in oil prices, if sustained, will boost growth. Recent data releases also point to weak domestic demand in the
euro area.
Downside risks identified in the October WEO remain significant. Heightened geopolitical tensions and
potential corrections in financial markets, including due to monetary policy normalization, are the main shortterm risks. Other risks are low inflation/deflation in the euro area and low potential growth.
Policy priorities are as follows:



Advanced economies should keep accommodative monetary policies, given still large output gaps and
very low inflation. Reflecting the uneven recovery, challenges are becoming increasingly different across
major central banks. While monetary policy normalization will be coming to the forefront in the United
States and the United Kingdom, accommodative monetary policy in the euro area and Japan should
continue to fight low inflation. To prevent premature monetary tightening, macro-prudential tools to
mitigate financial stability risks—for example, in the housing market—should be the first line of defense.
Fiscal consolidation should continue to balance fiscal sustainability and growth within credible mediumterm plans.



In emerging economies, the focus of macroeconomic policies should remain on rebuilding buffers and
addressing vulnerabilities, in preparation for an environment characterized by tighter external financing
conditions and higher volatility.



A higher priority should be placed on growth enhancing structural reforms across G20 economies. Some
countries with protracted current account surpluses should focus on boosting domestic demand or
modifying its composition. Further labor and product market reforms are needed in much of the euro
area. In a number of euro area countries severely affected by the crisis and emerging economies with
protracted current account deficits, there is a need for reforms which increase competitiveness, together
with wage moderation.



Finally, in economies with clearly identified needs and economic slack, current conditions are favorable for
increasing infrastructure investment. However, while this would support economic development, efficiency
of the investment process is important to maximize the growth dividend.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
An uneven global recovery continues, despite setbacks this year. Growth in the first half of the year
was weaker than expected, and it is now projected at 3.3 percent for 2014, 0.4 percentage point
lower relative to the April 2014 WEO. The growth projection for 2015 is slightly lower at
3.8 percent. These projections are predicated on the assumption that key conditions supporting the
recovery—highly accommodative monetary policy and moderating fiscal consolidation—remain in
place. Data released after the October 2014 WEO suggest that growth performance is in line with
projections in the United States and China, but there are downside risks to the outlook for the euro
area. Also, there was a correction in financial markets amid higher volatility, with equity prices
declining, notably for emerging economies where risk spreads increased, and oil prices fell
appreciably. Downside risks continue to be associated with geopolitical tensions, further corrections
in financial markets, low inflation in some advanced economies, low potential growth globally, and
secular stagnation in advanced economies, and U.S. monetary policy normalization.
1.
Despite setbacks this year, the global recovery continues but remains weak and
unbalanced. With a brittle, uneven recovery, slower-than-expected growth, and increasing
downside risks, there is a need to avoid settling into “new mediocre”. Growth in the first half of
the year was less than projected in the April 2014 WEO, in part reflecting temporary disruptions
(e.g. unusually harsh weather and an inventory correction after an earlier buildup in the United
States) as well as geopolitical tensions (e.g. Russia, Ukraine, and some Middle-Eastern countries).
Other factors, though, have also played a role. In some advanced economies, notably the euro
area, legacies of the boom and the subsequent crisis—including high private and public debt—
still weigh on the recovery despite supportive financial conditions, bringing the economy to a
halt in the second quarter. Lackluster domestic demand in emerging economies, as well as
supply bottlenecks in some, has also been more persistent than forecast—particularly in Latin
America, driven by Brazil where investment remains weak and GDP contracted in the first and
second quarters. Emerging economies continue adjusting to slower economic growth than the
pre-crisis boom and the post-crisis recovery. Overall, the pace of recovery is becoming more
country specific.
2.
Looking forward, the October WEO envisaged that the recovery will regain some
strength in the remainder of 2014 and 2015. The key drivers supporting the recovery remain
in place, including moderating fiscal consolidation, highly accommodative monetary policy in
most advanced economies, and strengthening balance sheets. Global growth is projected to
rebound to an annual rate of about 3.7 percent in the second half of 2014 and slightly higher in
2015. In advanced economies, this is mainly driven by a rebound in the United States. In
emerging economies, the recovery is driven by the waning of temporary setbacks to domestic
demand and production, the gradual lifting of impediments to growth, and policy support to
demand.


2

In advanced economies, growth is generally expected to strengthen in 2014 and 2015—to
1.8 and 2.3 percent respectively—but prospects are uneven and growth has been revised
downward in some economies, notably in the euro area and Japan (Table 1). The United
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

States is expected to experience the strongest rebound—with growth reaching more than
3 percent in 2015—and growth is also expected to remain solid in the United Kingdom,
Canada, and several Asian advanced economies. In the euro area, on the other hand, while the
moderating fiscal consolidation and the further monetary easing should support activity,
growth is projected to strengthen more gradually and unevenly as the crisis-legacy brakes
ease only slowly. Growth is resuming in Spain and projections have been revised slightly
upwards compared to the April WEO, but forecasts have been revised downwards in Italy,
Germany, and France. In Japan, given that the recovery in private consumption has been
slower than expected and the underlying momentum for private investment is weak,
projections have been lowered compared to the April WEO.


In most emerging economies, growth is expected to increase moderately in the second half
of 2014 and into 2015 (averaging 4.4 and 5 percent for these years, respectively), reflecting
stronger domestic demand and external demand associated with faster growth in advanced
economies. China’s growth, however, is projected to moderate slightly in 2015 (to
7.1 percent, from 7.4 percent in 2014), as the economy transitions to a more sustainable path,
and residential investment slows further. In India, growth is expected to increase as exports
and investment pick up, helped by lower political uncertainty, several positive policy actions,
improved business confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Growth for Latin America
is projected at 1.3 percent in 2014 and 2.2 percent in 2015, marked down for both 2014 and
2015 (by over 1 and 0.8 percentage points respectively relative to the spring), reflecting
weaker-than-expected export performance amid deteriorating terms of trade, as well as
various idiosyncratic domestic constraints. In Russia, activity will be impacted by structural
bottlenecks and lower oil prices, further affected by geopolitical tensions; and activity is not
projected to pick up before 2015 (with growth projected at 0.5 percent).

3.
Key developments since the October WEO include a financial market correction,
sharply lower oil prices, and further signs of weakness in some advanced economies
(Figure 1). Specifically:


Financial conditions remain supportive of the recovery, but the recent increase in volatility is a
reminder of potential risks. Long-term bond yields in advanced economies, which had fallen
since the spring, declined further in October. The Euro and the Yen depreciated against the
U.S. dollar. Equity valuations edged higher until mid-September, but have declined since,
notably in emerging economies, where risk spreads have increased and exchange rates have
depreciated. The recent comprehensive assessment of European banks found a manageable
capital shortfall of €9.5 billion after taking into account capital raised this year, but also
registered a large increase in the stock of non-performing loans. Swift action is now needed
to deal with the few banks identified by the assessment as being in need of further capital,
and to resolve non-performing assets. Overall, while tail risks have decreased and balance
sheet repair has progressed, the recent increase in volatility is a reminder about the
challenges ahead.



Oil prices have fallen sharply (by almost 20 percent) since early September. Several factors
have been at play. Weaker than expected activity since the spring has weighed on oil
demand, but its impact on prices has initially been muted by increased precautionary
demand and the restocking cycle. Higher-than-expected production in non-OPEC countries,
led by shale oil in the United States and recovering output in Libya, has also played a role. In
light of higher supply and the fact that some of the weakness in demand is already reflected
in the WEO baseline, the decline in prices will—ceteris paribus—boost global growth. Weak
oil prices will have a different impact across regions, easing the pressure on external position
of net oil importers with current account deficits, while posing an additional downside risk for
producers in emerging economies where which growth is already decelerating.



Recent data releases point to weak growth in the euro area. External demand was weak,
reflecting in part the growth moderation in China, but domestic demand was also
surprisingly weak (notably, in Germany). Recent data also shows disappointing industrial
production (e.g., Germany, France), raising concerns over stalling growth in the euro area. In
Japan, recent indicators show that the recovery is weak but still ongoing. Finally, weakness in
industrial production in India and consumer and investor confidence in Korea point to the
sluggishness of the recovery.

4.
Increased downside risks identified in the October WEO persist. In the short term,
geopolitical risks and an abrupt correction in financial markets—including due to monetary
policy normalization in the United States and the United Kingdom—are the main risks. Over the
medium term, the key risks are low potential growth in both advanced and emerging economies
and a prolonged period of weak demand in major advanced economies that could turn into
stagnation.


Geopolitical tensions heightened and may increase further. Developments in Ukraine and
Russia could trigger an escalation of sanctions and large spillovers in other parts of the
world, including via confidence effects. Similarly,



Risks to activity from low inflation remain relevant,
especially for the euro area. Inflation continues to remain
below the ECB target, and longer-term inflation
expectations have begun drifting downward. With policy
rates at the zero bound, negative shocks can lower
inflation or expectations further, raising real rates,
hampering the recovery and increasing debt burdens.



An increase in risk premia and volatility in global financial
markets, triggered by higher global risk aversion, liquidity shocks associated with the increased
role of the shadow banking system, or faster-than-expected normalization of U.S. monetary
policy. An increase in global risk aversion can be associated with further declines in U.S. longterm yields but still lead to a capital flow reversals and exchange rate pressures in emerging
markets, as well as negative effects on equity prices. Uncertainty about the cyclical position in
the U.S. can amplify risks associated with faster than expected tightening in monetary policy.
Against the backdrop of the still low risk spreads and volatility indicators, such surprises
could trigger financial market corrections.



In the medium term, there is a risk of low potential growth in both advanced and emerging
economies. In addition to the implications of weaker potential growth, the major advanced
economies, especially the euro area and Japan, could face an extended period of low growth
reflecting persistently weak private demand—especially investment—that could turn into
stagnation, with a further adverse impact on potential growth. As for emerging economies,
several years of slowing growth prospects brings to the forefront the risk that potential
growth could disappoint further.

POLICIES: MANAGING RISKS AND BOOSTING GROWTH1
Policy priorities center on supporting demand, strengthening supply over time through structural
reforms as well as infrastructure investment in some economies, and managing key risks.
Macroeconomic policies need to continue supporting the recovery in advanced economies, given
still large output gaps and very low inflation. Macro-prudential policies are an important first line
of defense to address potential financial stability threats associated with a protracted period of low
interest rates. In emerging economies, macroeconomic policies should continue preparing for a new
environment characterized by tighter external financial conditions. A higher priority needs to be put
on policies aimed at raising today’s actual and tomorrow’s potential growth—by restoring
confidence, boosting investment, reforming labor and product markets, and raising productivity
and competitiveness.

ADVANCED ECONOMIES NEED TO FIGHT LOW INFLATION AND SUSTAIN THE RECOVERY
5.
Prospects for an uneven recovery points to an asynchronous unwinding of
monetary stimulus in advanced economies. With output gaps still large, and inflation running
below target, accommodative monetary conditions remain essential to support demand.
However, the unbalanced recovery across economies suggests that challenges faced by central
banks differ, with well-crafted communication continuing to play a critical role, given that
protracted monetary support has raised financial stability concerns:


In the United States, with growth expected to increase
above trend in the remainder of 2014 and 2015, the main
policy issue is the appropriate speed of monetary policy
normalization. The timing of the policy rate increase
should be attuned to inflation and labor market
developments. In the United Kingdom, still accommodative
monetary policy has been combined with macroprudential tools to contain financial stability risks.

if the inflation outlook does not improve and inflation expectations continue to drift down,
the ECB should be willing to do more, including purchases of sovereign assets.



In Japan, monetary policy has helped lift inflation and inflation expectations. On October
31st, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) expanded its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing
(QQE) framework by accelerating purchases of JGBs (and extending their maturity) and

tripling the purchases of private assets, which should support domestic demand. For these
measures to succeed, they need to be supported by growth and fiscal reforms.
6.
Macro-prudential tools should be the first line of defense against financial stability
risks. Excessive risk-taking may have built in some sectors—credit booms in a number of smaller
advanced economies and the underpricing of risks in certain segments of U.S. financial
markets—after more than five years of exceptionally low rates. Deploying macro-prudential
tools—which in some cases may require changes to regulatory and legal structures—is essential
to limit financial risks and reduce the risk of monetary policy tightening not warranted by the
cyclical position. It will also make systemic institutions more resilient, help contain pro-cyclical
asset price and credit dynamics, and cushion the consequences of liquidity squeezes if volatility
spikes.
7.
Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, with the pace and composition of fiscal
adjustment—where needed—attuned to supporting the recovery. Fiscal consolidation should
proceed gradually, anchored in credible medium-term plans, which are lacking in some countries
(notably Japan and the United States). At the same time, the design of fiscal policy should
support growth, including by enhancing infrastructure investment (see Annex) where needs have
been identified, there is slack in the economy, and investment processes are relatively efficient
(e.g., Germany and the United States). When there is economic slack and monetary
accommodation, short-run demand effects are stronger, and the boost in output can lead to a
decline in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio. Provided that there is space, a supportive fiscal stance
can help offset short-term adverse effects of structural reforms on aggregate demand, bringing
forward the growth benefits. In response to negative growth surprises in the euro area flexibility
within the fiscal governance framework could and should be used where possible to avoid
triggering additional consolidation efforts. Finally, the pace of fiscal withdrawal in 2014–15 is
broadly appropriate in Japan, but a post-2015 consolidation plan remains needed.

EMERGING ECONOMIES HAVE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT
8.
Macroeconomic policies should aim at addressing vulnerabilities, considering the
potential impact on activity. A protracted deceleration in activity during the last years has
increased vulnerabilities and reduced policy space in some economies with inflation above target
and weaker fiscal positions. The prospects for financial tightening may bring about changes in
risk sentiment such that investors are less forgiving and macroeconomic weakness is more costly.
In this context, addressing vulnerabilities—which has been instrumental before the global crisis—
will be critical going forward:


In some economies (Brazil, India, Turkey), maintaining the course of fiscal consolidation is
critical, given large fiscal deficits and high inflation in some cases, and high external
borrowing that has increased exposure to external funding risks in others. Monetary policy
tightening may also be necessary should inflation expectations worsen.



Rapid credit expansion has become a potential source of vulnerabilities in some economies,
calling for greater attention to monitoring the financial sector and exposures of non-financial
firms, and to enforcing prudential regulation and supervision, as well as macro-prudential
measures. This is critical in China, where rebalancing towards domestic demand has
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

proceeded through booming investment and credit, with intermediation taking place not
only through banks, but also the shadow banking sector and local government lending.


As in advanced economies, and with the same caveats, infrastructure investment is needed to
ease supply bottlenecks (e.g., Brazil, India, South Africa) and support economic development.



Exchange rate flexibility, alongside credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks and FX
intervention to manage volatility, has also proven essential in coping with volatile capital
flows. Some economies (e.g., South Africa, Turkey) rely heavily on private external financing
and should proactively further adjust policies.

ACTION BY ALL MEMBERS FOR STRONGER AND MORE BALANCED GROWTH SHOULD BE A PRIORITY
9.
To strengthen growth potential, structural reforms should become a higher
priority. The G20 has set the objective of raising collective output by at least 2 percent above the
October 2013 WEO baseline over the coming five years. In addition, growth–enhancing structural
reform is particularly relevant in emerging economies that have experienced a gradual,
protracted and broad based slowdown over the past several years. On top of infrastructure
investment, actions are needed in other areas:


Structural reforms to improve the functioning of product markets—Japan, some European
countries severely affected by the crisis and emerging economies. To enhance productivity,
removing infrastructure bottlenecks in the energy sector (India, South Africa), reforms to
education, labor and product markets (Brazil, China, India, South Africa), and easing limits on
trade and investment and improving business conditions (Brazil, Indonesia, Russia) would be
instrumental.



Labor market reforms are needed in several countries. Reforms to raise labor force
participation, including of women and/or older workers, are critical in advanced economies
undergoing population aging (Japan, Korea, and the United States). Actions to increase labor
demand and remove impediments to employment, including reducing duality in labor
markets where relevant, are key where an important fraction of the population remains
unemployed (stressed euro area economies, South Africa).

10.
While global current account imbalances have narrowed in 2013, they are still
larger than desirable and further reduction is essential for more balanced growth. Policy
actions required to further narrow excessive imbalances vary but include medium-term fiscal
consolidation, limiting financial excesses, and structural reforms to facilitate adjustment in deficit
economies and countries with high net external liabilities. Trade integration should be an
essential component in the global policy agenda as well, to ensure that the trading system
remains open and foster a new momentum in global growth. In economies with protracted
current account surpluses, policies that support stronger domestic demand would help, including
boosting domestic demand, moving toward more market-based exchange rates, avoiding
sustained, one-sided foreign exchange market policies, and reducing capital account restrictions.
Taken as a whole, policy actions are needed on both sides of excess imbalances, and policy
adjustments by all would be mutually supporting, with benefits in terms of growth and reduction
of financial risks.

ANNEX. THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PUBLIC
INVESTMENT
Infrastructure investment has been a signature issue
under the Australian G20 Presidency, with the
objective of establishing a multi-year Global
Infrastructure Initiative as a part of the Brisbane
Action Plan. Accordingly, this annex provides
supporting material for that objective by elaborating
on the macroeconomic rationale for pursuing this
policy goal as well as expanding the discussion of
efficiency of public investment management,
including by previewing additional work on the
subject.

The stock of public capital has declined substantially as a share of
output over the past three decades across advanced, emerging
market, and developing economies. In per capita terms, non–
advanced economies still have only a fraction of the public capital
available in advanced economies.

The analysis of the benefits and costs of additional infrastructure investment requires a clear
picture of its macroeconomic effects. Chapter 3 of the October 2014 WEO finds that increased
public infrastructure investment raises output, in the short term through demand effects and the
crowding in of private investment, and in the long term by raising productive capacity. In
advanced economies, a 1 percentage point of GDP increase in investment spending increases the
level of output by about 0.4 percent in the same year and by 1.5 percent four years after the
increase. These effects vary with a number of mediating factors, including (1) the degree of
economic slack and monetary accommodation, (2) the efficiency of public investment, and (3)
how public investment is financed. When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation,
short-run demand effects are stronger, and the boost in output can actually lead to a decline in
the public-debt-to-GDP ratio. If the efficiency of the public investment process is relatively low,
higher investment leads to more limited long-term output gains. Finally, an increase in public
investment that is financed by issuing debt has larger output effects than a “budget-neutral”
increase that is financed by raising taxes or cutting other spending, although both options
deliver similar declines in the debt-to-GDP ratio under some conditions. For economies with
clearly identified infrastructure needs and efficient public investment processes, and where there
is economic slack and monetary accommodation,

emerging market economies, because the lack of stack implies an
immediate monetary policy response, and because public
investment efficiency is relatively lower.

Many countries have a pressing need for additional
infrastructure to support economic development.
Increasing public investment will boost output, but
long-run gains depend on investment efficiency. In
developing economies, the experience with public
investment has varied widely, and the empirical
estimates of the macroeconomic effects are much
less precise. Model-based simulations suggest that
public investment does raise output in both the short
and long term, but at the cost of raising the publicdebt-to-GDP ratio, given absence of economic slack
and inefficiencies in public investment (Figure 2).
Thus, negative fiscal consequences should be
carefully weighed against the broader social gains
from increased public investment. For those
emerging market and developing economies where
infrastructure bottlenecks are currently constraining
growth, the gains from alleviating these bottlenecks
are likely to be large.

Making the Most of Public Investment
Increasing investment efficiency is critical to mitigating the possible trade-off between higher
output and higher public debt. Thus, a key priority in many economies, particularly in those with

relatively low efficiency of public investment, should be to raise the quality of infrastructure
investment by improving the public investment process. Improvement could involve, among
other reforms, better project appraisal and selection that identifies and targets infrastructure
bottlenecks, including through centralized independent reviews, rigorous cost-benefit analysis,
and zero-based budgeting principles.
Given the large expected infrastructure investment needs in many economies over the coming
years, facilitating increased private financing and provision of infrastructure will be very
important. Financing and provision of infrastructure can help ease fiscal constraints, generate
efficiency gains, and increase investment returns. The macroeconomic effects of private
infrastructure investment are likely to be similar to those of public infrastructure investment; to
the extent that the private sector is more efficient in reducing waste and only investing in
projects with sufficiently high return, then the long-term effects could be higher.
Private participation in infrastructure via public-private partnerships (PPPs) has been on the rise
over the past two decades (Figure 1, dashed red lines), but it is still low. It represents less than 10
percent of public investment in emerging markets and advanced economies, and less than a
quarter in low-income countries. There is strong potential for boosting private participation
substantially as long-term investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign
wealth funds want to provide the necessary financing.
Well-structured and well-implemented PPPs offer the prospect of efficiency gains. They can
lower government’s costs and raise returns. However, PPPs can also be used to bypass spending
controls, and move public investment off-budget and debt off the government balance sheet.
Governments can end up bearing most of the risk and facing large fiscal costs over the mediumto-long term. It is therefore essential that countries maintain maximum standards of fiscal
transparency when using PPPs.
Going forward, there is a need to evaluate the efficiency of public investment for a range of
advanced, emerging, and developing countries, including the G20, and the strength of public
investment management procedures, by analyzing: (i) the recent trends in public and private
investment in economic and social infrastructure; (ii) factors that help to explain the variation in
efficiency of that investment in improving economic and social outcomes; (iii) the role of public
investment management institutions; and (iv) the priorities for strengthening public investment
management practices across different groups of countries.
