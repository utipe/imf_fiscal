EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery has evolved better than previously anticipated, but it is proceeding
at different speeds within and across regions. Recovery in advanced economies is being
largely driven by extraordinary policy support and the turn in the inventory cycle, while in
key emerging economies strong domestic demand, improvement in global trade and higher
commodity prices are adding to the growth impetus.
The speed of recovery is expected to vary considerably across G-20 countries, with
weaker and more fragile growth in most advanced economies contrasting with robust
expansions in most emerging economies, particularly in Asia. After contracting by
0.6 percent in 2009, global output is expected to expand by 4.2 percent in 2010, an upward
revision of 0.3 percentage points from the January World Economic Outlook update, with
growth projected at 4.3 percent in 2011.
Concerns about advanced country fiscal sustainability and sovereign risks have come to
the fore. There is an urgent need to design and implement credible fiscal policy strategies to
bring down gross debt-to-GDP ratios over the medium. In the short term, absent such plans,
high debt ratios could impede fiscal flexibility, increase the vulnerability of fiscally
challenged economies, and constrain growth.
A multispeed recovery means that policy challenges will vary due to individual country
circumstances. With recovery in most advanced G-20 economies expected to be weak, the
fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented fully. Tightening could begin in
2011, when the recovery is expected to become self sustaining.
Looking further ahead, policymakers have outlined strategies for exit from crisisrelated intervention policies, although these are not underpinned by sufficiently specific
measures in all cases. For countries with high levels of public debt, a clarification of
strategies would be essential, with fiscal consolidation taking priority and with monetary
policy able to play a balancing role to achieve a desired level of overall stimulus. In some
emerging economies, particularly in Asia, monetary policy may have to be tightened
relatively soon and ahead of fiscal consolidation due to concerns about overheating, credit
quality, and asset price bubbles. In others, particularly some in Latin America, the opposite
sequencing will be appropriate.
Some emerging market countries may have to adopt policies to manage large capital
inflows. The resumption of capital flows to these countries, which is fundamentally
welcome, is being driven rapid growth and yield differentials, and has led to concerns about
asset price bubbles in some cases. The right responses to inflows will differ across countries,
including fiscal tightening to ease pressure on interest rates and greater exchange rate
flexibility. Macro-prudential policies aimed at limiting the emergence of asset price bubbles,
reserves accumulation, and carefully designed changes to capital controls may also be part of
the appropriate responses in certain cases.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICY CHALLENGES
The global recovery has been stronger than previously anticipated, but it is proceeding at
different speeds within and across regions. In 2010, world output is expected to rise by about
4.2 percent. In major advanced economies, activity remains dependent on accommodative
macroeconomic policies. Fiscal and monetary policies should maintain a supportive thrust
this year to further sustain growth and employment; on current projections, withdrawal of
stimulus can begin in 2011. However, room for countercyclical policy maneuver has sharply
diminished as fiscal fragilities have come to the fore. These economies need to urgently
adopt credible strategies to achieve fiscal sustainability. In many emerging economies,
where activity is expected to be relatively vigorous, largely due to buoyant internal demand,
an earlier exit from policy stimulus is warranted. The global outlook is subject to risks that,
on balance, are to the downside, with increasing concerns over sovereign risks.
I. A POLICY-DRIVEN MULTISPEED RECOVERY
1.
The global recovery has evolved more strongly than expected, reflecting a
pickup in confidence among consumers and businesses as well as in financial markets,
and is progressing at different speeds within and across regions. In the G-20, real output
growth increased by nearly 5 percent at an annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Growth in the advanced G-20 economies was about 3 percent in the same period, led by the
United States, Canada and Japan. Momentum in emerging G-20 economies continued to be
stronger, with output growth at nearly 8 percent. Strong performance in China, India, and
Brazil was accompanied by a broadening of the recovery to Russia and South Africa.

2.
The recovery in advanced economies remains dependent on policy support,
boosted by a turn in the inventory cycle and improved financial conditions, while strong
domestic demand and recovering trade have driven the recovery in emerging economies.
Extraordinary policy interventions helped lay a foundation for the recovery, and have been

3
essential to prevent adverse feedbacks between the financial and real economies, although the
risk of deflation cannot yet be dismissed.


Among advanced economies, a turn in the inventory cycle, alongside strong orders
and a recovering corporate bond market have helped foster investment. Slowing
deterioration in U.S. labor markets has also contributed to positive developments.
However, the euro area’s strong dependence on impaired bank credit has curbed
activity. Large appreciation of the yen may have weighed on the recovery of Japan’s
exports.



In emerging economies, the recovery has been driven by strong domestic demand and
the normalization of global trade, which has helped lift external demand. This is
particularly the case in major emerging economies—China, India, and Brazil—where
output significantly exceeds pre-crisis levels. Commodity price increases and the
rebound in global trade have also been important, particularly in Russia, South
Africa, and Mexico.

3.
Concerns about advanced country
sovereign risks have risen sharply. Sovereign
risk premiums for some of the more fiscally
vulnerable economies have again seen a steep
increase. Deterioration of fiscal balances and
rapid accumulation of public debt has led to
concerns about the sustainability of sovereigns’
balance sheets. Specifically, there is concern that
sharply higher sovereign risks in Greece can
spillover to the domestic banking system and
across borders.
4.
Banking system health has improved, but deleveraging pressures and funding
concerns suggest that credit recovery will be slow and shallow. In many advanced G-20
economies, expected bank write-downs have been lowered and some banks have raised
private capital and posted strong earnings, resulting in lower aggregate capital needs.
However, the anticipation of further writedowns and a more stringent regulatory
environment, along with large refinancing requirements in the next two years suggests that
bank balance sheets are likely to remain constrained, particularly in Europe. Among
emerging G-20 economies, credit is accelerating in emerging Asia; in China, while credit
growth is now decelerating, growth rates are still high and the Chinese authorities have taken
various measures to moderate the pace of lending.
5.
Capital flows to emerging economies have resumed, leading to a welcome easing
of financial conditions but also raising concerns about overheating, credit quality, and
asset price bubbles in some economies. Prospects of strong growth, higher interest rates,

4
and lower sovereign credit risks than in mature economies lie behind the strong inflows into
emerging economies. Portfolio inflows have led the way. However, direct investment and
cross-border bank lending have not recovered to the same extent, with the latter reflecting
continued deleveraging by advanced economy banks.

6.
The multispeed nature of the recovery, renewed risk appetite, and rebounding
capital flows to emerging economies have led to some exchange rate changes between
the first and last quarters of 2009, but currency appreciation has been resisted in some
cases. Improving global financial conditions have resulted in depreciation of the U.S. dollar
in real terms since early 2009, as exchange

balances expected to rise noticeably as
commodity prices increase and global trade continues to recover.

5
7.
Commodity prices increased strongly at the onset of the recovery, driven largely
by robust growth in emerging economies, and upward price pressures will likely
continue. Earlier and stronger-than-expected recoveries in emerging economies, particularly
emerging Asia, have boosted commodity prices. Upward pressures on prices will remain as
global growth strengthens through 2010-11. However, price dynamics will also depend on
the supply response to rising demand, with still above average spare capacity and inventories
in some commodity sectors likely to provide some cushion. Oil prices have risen above the
$70-$80 a barrel range in recent weeks, as markets are testing producers’ readiness to tap
spare capacity with rapidly improving demand.
8.
Unemployment has begun to stabilize in some major advanced economies, but
unemployment rates will stay high through 2011.


In major advanced economies, unemployment has begun to stabilize. It remains high
in the United States and Spain, but relative to output declines, subdued in Germany
and the United Kingdom. Given the sluggish expected recovery and the lingering
effects of the financial crisis, unemployment rates are projected to stay high through
2011, although employment growth is expected to turn positive in many countries
during 2010.



In most emerging economies, increases in unemployment were more contained than
in the advanced economies, except in emerging Europe, particularly the Baltic nations
and the CIS. Unemployment also remains at very high levels in Russia and South
Africa.

II. PROSPECTS
9.
The recovery will continue to be multi-speed across G-20 countries, with tepid
growth in most of the advanced economies contrasting with robust expansion in
emerging economies, particularly in Asia. Global output is expected to rise by 4.2 percent
in 2010 and 4.3 percent in 2011 at annualized rates. Among G-20 economies, output growth
is projected to be about 4.6 percent in 2010, reflecting an upward revision of about
0.3 percentage point from the January WEO update, followed by 4.5 percent in 2011.


In advanced economies, output is projected to expand by 2.3 percent in 2010 and
2.4 percent in 2011, a sluggish recovery by historical standards, with real output
remaining below its pre-crisis level until late 2011. The turn in the inventory cycle
will help the recovery, as will improvements in financial conditions. Nonetheless,
policy support will remain essential for the recovery, until there are clear signs that
private demand is self-sustaining. Credit will remain constrained as banks repair
balance sheets, investment will be held back by low capacity utilization and
unemployment will weigh on consumption.



In emerging and developing economies, the recovery will be more robust than in
advanced economies, but uneven. Emerging Asia—notably, China, India, and
Indonesia— and to a lesser extent Latin America, will lead the way, fuelled by strong
internal and recovering external demand. Inventory investment is likely to make a
significant contribution to growth in the short run on account of the normalization of
globalization trade. The rebound of commodity prices will help growth in commodity
exporters. Recovery is lagging in emerging Europe, although some are beginning to
rebound from deep troughs. Overall, growth in emerging and developing economies
is expected to be about 6–6½ percent during 2010–11, following a modest 2½
percent in 2009.

10.
The outlook for public finances diverges significantly, with further deterioration
projected in advanced economies and more favorable prospects for emerging
economies.


Among advanced G-20 economies, large fiscal deficits are expected to continue, due
in part to large structural revenue losses and spending pressures, with improved
positions projected only in Japan and Korea. Large continuing deficits are projected
to raise the gross debt-to-GDP ratio to 120 percent in 2015, from around 80 percent in
2008. The crisis-related stimulus plays a relatively minor role, accounting for only
one-tenth (4 percentage points) of the debt increase. Although sizable structural
adjustments are projected through 2015, these are not enough to return fiscal
positions to pre-crisis levels and still need to be supported with concrete revenue and
spending measures.



The outlook is generally more favorable for emerging economies, with debt ratios
expected to decline moderately after 2010 and to remain, on average, below
40 percent of GDP in the medium term. Further, deficits should remain markedly
lower in emerging G-20 economies, reflecting the accelerating recovery in Asia and
Latin America, some discretionary tightening planned for 2010, the pick-up of
commodity prices, and in some cases, an initial exit to reduce vulnerabilities. There
are nevertheless risks to public finances for emerging economies with weaker
fundamentals, particularly from possible international spillovers, as the large debt
buildup in advanced economies could lead to higher borrowing costs.

11.
Inflation is likely to remain contained in most advanced economies as high
unemployment and large output gaps persist, while some emerging economies may face
stronger inflationary pressures.


In advanced economies, capacity utilization is likely to remain low given the
projected sluggish recovery and output gaps are projected to remain wide through
2010 even after accounting for the decline of potential output due to the financial
crisis. Accordingly, inflationary pressures will remain subdued so long as energy
prices remain stable or increase only modestly. In 2010, headline inflation is forecast
to increase to 1½ percent (from zero in 2009), as slowing labor costs are more than
offset by rebounding commodity prices.



Among emerging and developing economies, although sustained increases in inflation
are not projected during the recovery, inflation risk is pertinent in countries where
consumer prices are sensitive to commodity prices. Some emerging economies may
face upward price pressures due to strong growth and little excess capacity. These
include Brazil, India and Turkey, where markets are pricing in policy rate hikes

during 2010. Overall, inflation in emerging economies in 2010 is expected to remain
around 6 percent.

III. KEY RISKS
12.
The outlook for activity remains unusually uncertain, even if systemic risks have
receded. Broadly, key risks have moved from the financial sector to public finances,
with immediate concerns about fiscal sustainability in some euro area countries and
longer-term concerns at a global level. Downside risks to the outlook remain and
include:


A lack of progress on sovereign debt consolidation. In the near term, the main
concern is that sovereign liquidity and solvency problems in Greece could result in
rapid re-pricing of sovereign risks, with spillover to the domestic banking system and
across borders. More generally, in the absence of debt consolidation plans, risks
related to sovereign debt could depress output for a variety of reasons. This could
prompt premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus that undermines recovery or limit the
scope of new stimulus in response to new adverse shocks. As activity weakens,
households and investors could lose confidence in governments’ ability to design and
implement sound consolidation plans and in response sharply reduce their spending
because of concerns that taxes will increase or that prospects for growth, wages, and
investment returns will diminish.



Slow progress on bank restructuring, resolution, and recapitalization, especially to
address weak banks. Along with continued bank deleveraging, this could unduly
restrain the financial sector’s ability to support the recovery by providing credit.
Sectors that have only limited access to capital markets––consumers and small and

10
medium-size enterprises––are likely to continue to face tight borrowing conditions,
hampering the recovery.
13.
Upside risks include positive surprises with respect to investor confidence, which
would induce a reduction in financial uncertainty, foster a stronger-than-expected
improvement in financial market sentiment, and prompt a larger-than-expected rebound in
capital flows, trade, and private demand.
IV. POLICY CHALLENGES:
FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND FINANCIAL REFORM
Multispeed recoveries imply that policy challenges will vary according to individual country
circumstances. With the recovery in most advanced economies projected to be sluggish,
fiscal stimulus will need to be maintained in those economies through 2010, but tightening
could begin in 2011, provided recovery then becomes self sustaining. In addition,
consolidation may need to begin earlier in those countries with large public debts. Given
prospects for relatively weak growth in advanced economies, the challenge for some
emerging economies will be to absorb capital inflows and nurture domestic demand without
triggering a new boom-bust cycle.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal policy
14.
In many G-20 countries, restoring fiscal sustainability is a top priority and
policy challenge, notably in light of the surge in government debt levels. Ensuring fiscal
sustainability depends on ensuring growth, and so the provision of fiscal support will need to
be maintained until there are clear signs of a self-sustaining recovery. But beyond that, fiscal
consolidation will need to gain rapid momentum, notably in advanced economies. Some
major emerging economies will also need to return to medium-term fiscal considerations as
the recovery is established.


In many advanced G-20 economies, substantial consolidation will be needed to
ensure fiscal sustainability, foster medium-and-long-term growth and restore fiscal
space for future needs. This is particularly important for the United States, given its
systemically important role in global financial markets, but also for other advanced
economies that can affect the sovereign risk premiums of other countries.



Fiscal challenges are less pronounced in emerging G-20 and many advanced
economies which, as a group, entered the crisis with relatively low public debt
levels. However, in some emerging economies with relatively large public debt,
notably Brazil and India, public sector efforts to promote growth will have to be
funded by scaling back less productive spending and closing loopholes in the

11
revenue base. As the recovery is firmly established, fiscal policy will need to refocus
on medium-term considerations, including debt sustainability.
15.
Against this backdrop, exiting from fiscal stimulus should in general take
priority over other policies, particularly in advanced economies.


In sequencing an exit from crisis-related policies, fiscal policy should generally take
priority. Maintaining an expansionary fiscal stance has a direct impact on the buildup of debt. Accommodative monetary policy does not have such automatic
consequences and can be reversed quickly; in the current juncture, inflationary
pressures appear well contained. Furthermore, fiscal policy adjustment typically has a
long lead time relative to monetary policy. Hence, plans for fiscal consolidation
should generally take priority, all else given.



In countries with excessive current account surpluses and solid public finances, fiscal
exit can wait while excess demand pressures are being addressed by reining in credit
growth and allowing exchange rate appreciation. Greater currency adjustment in Asia
would facilitate adjustment in other emerging economies that may fear losing market
share if their currencies were to appreciate alone. Many emerging and developing
economies also need to continue strengthening their financial stability frameworks to
protect against speculative booms as they continue to attract capital.



In those emerging (and some advanced) economies experiencing faster recoveries,
particularly those with sufficient fiscal space, the desirable policy mix may be
different. In emerging economies that have large current account surpluses,
rebalancing their economies away from growth led by external demand to growth
underpinned by domestic demand is a key challenge. These challenges could be met
by strengthening social safety nets that result in reduced precautionary savings, or
through improved corporate governance that helps reduce corporate savings.

16.
In many advanced G-20 economies, authorities will need to urgently devise and
communicate credible medium-term fiscal policy strategies. These strategies should
include:


Clear timeframes to reduce gross debt-to-GDP ratios to sustainable levels. To return
debt ratios in advanced economies to relatively more prudent levels—for example, 60
percent of advanced-economy GDP by 2030 (the median level of debt in advanced
economies prior to the crisis)—requires adjustment of the order of 8.8 percentage
points of GDP in the next ten years.



Fiscal measures that seek to increase economies’ medium-run growth potentials.
Winding down fiscal stimulus measures will provide only about 2 percent of GDP;
additional fiscal measures will therefore be needed. Entitlement reforms and

12
improvements to tax and expenditure policies could help attain fiscal sustainability,
while promoting medium-run growth.


Strong fiscal policy frameworks and institutions with comprehensive coverage of the
public sector. Formally adopting or strengthening fiscal rules with explicit fiscal
targets and monitoring by independent fiscal agencies could help shore up the
necessary broad consensus, anchoring expectations and guiding fiscal policy
implementation over the medium term.

Monetary policy
17.
Monetary policy can remain accommodative in the major advanced countries,
but monetary tightening may be considered in some emerging economies facing risks of
overheating.


In advanced economies, central banks should maintain low policy rates through 2010,
as inflation is expected to remain low and unemployment high for some time.1 This
can be achieved even while central banks begin to withdraw the emergency support
provided to banks and financial markets. As the priority in major advanced
economies is to put in place sound medium-term fiscal programs, tightening monetary
policies prematurely, as fiscal support is phased out, could undercut global recovery.



In some emerging economies (e.g., Brazil, emerging Asia), owing to rapidly closing
output gaps or concerns about credit quality, monetary accommodation is already
being removed or will need be to be removed relatively soon. In those economies
with broadly balanced external positions, monetary tightening may be complicated as
it could attract capital inflows that undermine competitiveness.

Coping with large capital inflows
18.
In those emerging economies where there are concerns that the resumption of
capital inflows may cause new boom-bust cycles, there is a need to design policies to
manage the inflows. Some countries are resisting exchange rate appreciation that could
reduce excessive current account surpluses, out of concern that appreciation could destabilize
their economies. However, resistance to appreciation in some large economies could
undermine trade patterns or financial conditions for other emerging or advanced economies.


1

In surplus economies, greater exchange rate flexibility could help moderate capital
inflows by mitigating one-way bets. Stronger currencies would raise purchasing

Australia to raise policy rates since the final quarter of 2009.

13
power for domestic consumers, encouraging the shift in productive resources from
export to services sectors. Strengthening multilateral liquidity provisions and
insurance mechanisms through IFIs could promote greater exchange rate flexibility
by limiting incentives for excessive reserve accumulation.


Monetary and fiscal policies can be used to reduce inflows where further reserve
accumulation or exchange rate appreciation are not warranted. If the economy is not
at risk of overheating, the appropriate policy response would be to lower interest rates
and to tighten fiscal policy, thus reducing currency appreciation pressures. In
economies facing high inflationary pressures, reducing interest rates is not an
attractive option, while both political considerations and implementation lags may
limit the scope for fiscal consolidation.

19.
In some emerging economies, improvements in macro-prudential and
supervisory frameworks can help limit the risks from inflows, as changes in capital
controls can temper inflows and liberalize outflows.


Macro-prudential policies may offer a broader and longer term solution but do not
represent a panacea. Such policies can be used to address the potential for bubbles at
an early stage by limiting a buildup in risks. Limits on leverage and loan-to-value
ratios, as well as well-managed margining and collateral systems in securities
markets, may form part of this approach. However, deploying such policies requires
changes in prudential infrastructure that may take time to implement.



Capital controls could also help, especially in stemming temporary flows, but need to
be designed bearing mind costs, limitations, and constraints on implementation
capacity: (i) the likely erosion in their effectiveness over time in today’s deep and
sophisticated financial markets; (ii) implementation costs, such as those for an
enhanced system of unremunerated reserves; and (iii) the creation of distortions in the
domestic financial system.



Consideration should also be given to the deleterious multilateral repercussions of
capital controls. Their widespread use could have adverse effects on the efficient
allocation of investment and, for systemically important countries, they could impede
global demand rebalancing by allowing countries to avoid appreciation where
currencies are undervalued. Their adoption may also divert rather than prevent flows,
complicating the management of inflows for other countries, and triggering contagion
in the use of capital controls.
B. Financial Sector Policies

20.
Financial sector repair and reform is the other top priority in a number of
advanced G-20 economies. The policy challenge is shifting from unwinding extraordinary
support measures to laying the foundation for a more robust financial system. Given the

14
increasingly integrated nature of financial markets and institutions, effective repair, reform,
and deployment of macro-prudential tools will require coordination across countries.
21.
In the short term, major work is still needed to repair damage to the financial
system wrought by the crisis. These include:


Bank recapitalization. Larger capital buffers are required to absorb the ongoing and
expected deterioration in credit quality. Prudent bank managements should continue
to build buffers of high quality capital now in anticipation of more demanding
standards expected in the future, which would relieve some pressure on banks to
deleverage their balance sheets, and also provide a solid base to extend credit
necessary for the global recovery.



Bank consolidation, resolution, and restructuring. Urgent priorities include: (i) swift
restructuring and resolution of nonviable institutions to ensure a healthy core of
viable financial institutions remains; and (ii) introduce market infrastructure,
regulatory and legal reforms that address systemic risk.



Reviving securitization markets. These remain impaired, yet had been a normal part
of the bank lending process in many advanced economies. To promote sound
securitization, measures need to be taken to improve monitoring along the
securitization chain, including by improving disclosure standards, standardizing
securitization structures, and restoring the integrity of the ratings process.

22.
Coordinated regulatory reforms to the financial sector, that are designed to
reduce systemic risks, need to move forward expeditiously, after being adequately
evaluated. Reforms to the financial sector will entail more and better quality capital and
liquidity buffers, that will help remove excess capacity and restrict a build-up in leverage.
Three years after the onset of the crisis, questions still remain about how policymakers will
address the potential of too-important-to fail (TITF) institutions to harm the financial system
and impose costs on the public sector and its taxpayers. This will require measures on various
fronts. In particular, there is an urgent need for some combination of ex ante preventive
measures as well as improved ex post resolution mechanisms, and clarity on the legal powers
that could intervene in troubled cross-border TITF institutions. Additional requirements
could include calibrating institutions’ capital requirements to systemic risks, as proposed by
the Basel Committee. The window of opportunity for dealing with TITF institutions may be
closing and should not be squandered, all the more so because some of these institutions have
become bigger and more dominant than before the crisis erupted.

15
V. PROGRESS ON EXITS FROM STIMULUS POLICIES
The appropriate timing, pace, and mode of exits depend on the state of the economy and the
financial system. Unwinding stimulus too early could jeopardize progress in securing
recovery while delaying exits too long could pose risks to price, financial, and fiscal stability.
For many G-20 countries, restoring fiscal sustainability is a key priority that will require not
only unwinding crisis-related fiscal stimulus but also substantial improvements in primary
balances for a sustained period. Although most advanced G-20 countries have set out broad
medium-term fiscal goals, few have specified how and when consolidation will proceed.
Immediate steps can be taken on reforms (especially to entitlements) that would not depress
current demand. Against this background, the following discussion takes stock of progress on
exits from extraordinary fiscal, monetary and financial sector support.
Fiscal policies
23.
Most advanced G-20 countries have set out broad medium-term fiscal
consolidation targets but few have specified the composition of the adjustment. Mediumterm plans are summarized in Table 4. Several countries have announced expenditure-based
plans (France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States), but concrete steps have not as yet
been taken. Plans should be clarified soon to bolster credibility.
24.
Fiscal exit plans in some advanced G-20 countries seem to be based on optimistic
assumptions. Staff projections for the April 2010 World Economic Outlook show higher
deficits for most advanced G-20 countries, based on assumptions about paths for growth and
revenues as well as uncertainties about the exact consolidation measures to be implemented.
25.
In most countries, a combination of revenue and spending measures will be
needed. Fiscal adjustment should aim to (i) stabilize age-related spending in relation to GDP,
(ii) reduce non-age-related expenditure ratios, and (iii) increase revenues in an efficient
manner. While the precise mix will vary across countries, the large size of the required
adjustment in most advanced G-20 countries will likely require tax measures, as a freeze on
real per capita spending (other than health and pensions) would be insufficient to generate the
necessary adjustment. In emerging economies, stronger and better-targeted safety nets will be
needed along with efficiency-enhancing revenue and spending measures.
More specifically:


Revenues. High pre-existing tax burdens may limit the scope to raise tax rates without
adverse efficiency effects. Countries may have scope to increase revenues from
closing VAT gaps by eliminating exemptions and reduced rates, as well as from
raising excises and fuel taxes. Pricing greenhouse gas emissions—by taxing carbon or
auctioning emissions permits—could raise large sums. Property taxes are also an
efficient source of revenues with a benign impact on growth. There may also be scope
for stronger income taxation, in part to address equity objectives, though efficiency

16
concerns loom larger. In some emerging G-20 countries, the scope for improving
revenue collections appears to be substantial, although adjustment needs are
comparatively smaller.


Expenditures. To ensure growth and equity, reforms of inefficient, poorly targeted, or
inequitable spending areas will be needed, along with intensive efforts to contain
pension and health pressures. A key focus should be on wages—containing the public
sector wage bill has proven to be important in past consolidation episodes—as well as
on subsidies and transfers. Social benefits could be better targeted, reducing overall
spending levels without sacrificing equity objectives. Better targeting long-term
unemployment benefits in some countries could provide savings and favorable labor
market effects. Subsidies should also be lowered, especially for petroleum products,
which absorb about 1 percent of world GDP.

26.
Only a few countries have already identified pension or health reforms as part of
exit strategies.2 In France and Japan, for example, pension and health reforms are explicitly
on the agenda, but concrete plans have not been announced. Many countries have plans to
expand health or pension coverage (Brazil, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and
U.S.).


To stabilize pension spending, the typical options are: (i) raising the statutory
retirement age, (ii) reducing benefits, or (iii) increasing contribution rates. An
increase in the retirement age by two years would stabilize pension spending as a
share of GDP at 2010 levels for the next two decades. This is roughly equivalent to a
cut in benefits of 15 percent or a 2 percentage-point increase in payroll taxes. While
higher retirement ages may be largely justified by increases in longevity over the next
20 years, these would need to be accompanied by steps to limit early retirement
programs. Benefits could also be reduced by modifying the base used to calculate
benefits, modifying indexation rules, or taxing pensions.3 Cuts in pensions, however,
should preserve benefits sufficient to keep the elderly out of poverty.



In health care, the challenges are greater—while some countries have managed to
reform their pension systems significantly, there have been few health reforms aimed
at reducing spending. Reforms need to contain spending growth, while ensuring
broad access to high quality care by addressing supply-side incentives, limiting public

2
3

In some advanced countries with moderate adjustment needs, pension reforms were introduced in recent years.

Changes in rates of social contributions need to be assessed together with potential changes in the rate of
personal tax on labor income, as this tax wedge likely affects labor participation and hours worked decisions.
The incentive effects of social contributions, however, would depend on whether they are perceived as implying
increased benefit entitlement.

17
benefits, and/or reducing demand for public health services. Cost-containing
measures include: (i) reimbursing providers using case-based payment or global
budgets rather than a fee-for-service basis; (ii) strengthening cost-effectiveness
evaluations for new treatments and technology; and (iii) implementing health
information technology to increase the efficiency of service delivery. Demand-side
measures include increasing cost sharing and reducing subsidies to private health
insurance.


In major emerging economies with large surpluses, fiscal measures could usefully be
targeted toward improved programs for health care, pensions, and education. China,
in particular, can afford to maintain an expansionary fiscal stance as it seeks to
rebalance externally generated and domestically driven growth, including by
expanding subsidized health insurance for rural workers and strengthening its pension
system.

Monetary Policies
27.
Conventional measures of monetary policy remain highly accommodative and
will likely need to be maintained at least through 2010 (see above). Central banks should
continue their efforts to unwind liquidity provision as long as market conditions warrant, but
they should remain alert to signs of stress and stand ready to take renewed support measures
if needed. The timing and modalities of asset sales will need to be carefully managed to
avoid disrupting financial and credit markets.
28.
With some exceptions, central banks have begun the process of gradually
unwinding unconventional policies:


The Federal Reserve has ceased its program of purchasing residential mortgagebacked securities and debt ($1.25 trillion and about $175 billion, respectively). The
Federal Reserve has also been closing the special liquidity facilities that it created to
support markets during the crisis, leaving only the Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility, which is scheduled to be closed in June 2010. The ECB has begun the
process of unwinding its liquidity support program, by restricting the occasions on
which it meets in full banks' demands for funds. In December, it announced the end
of 12-month funds offers to banks, and, in February, made the last offering of sixmonth funds. It will continue to provide unlimited liquidity in weekly and monthly
offers until at least October. The Bank of England has purchased bonds in the
targeted amount of £200bn, with no current plans for an extension of the quantitative
easing program. However, the Bank of Japan has stepped up its monetary stimulus in
response to a fragile economic recovery.



Foreign exchange swap arrangements between central banks to provide liquidity to
offshore markets have mostly expired. The large asset purchases by central banks

18
have stopped and liquidity facilities to domestic funding markets have been scaled
back. However, financial fragilities remain and unwinding remains dependent on
financial and economic conditions.
Financial Sector Policies
29.
Although some governments have taken their first steps to end some of the
public support measures put in place in response to the financial crisis, others have
extended the existing facilities. In the US, a limited six-month Emergency Guarantee
Facility was established on October 31, 2009, upon expiration of the Debt Guarantee
Program (DGP; part of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program or TLGP). At the end of
2009, several European countries granted extension of their debt guarantee schemes for
periods ranging from four months (Sweden) to six months (Austria, Greece, Portugal and
Finland) to as much as twelve months (Germany). Ireland introduced a new guarantee
program on new eligible debt issued through September 29, 2010. In contrast, Korea’s
authorization to provide state guarantees to domestic banks expired on December 31, 2009.
30.
Despite the extension of several programs, the use of government-guaranteed
debt has declined substantially. Guaranteed bonds issued by financial institutions have now
fallen from a peak of over 40 percent of total gross supply in March 2009 to less than
5 percent during the first three months of this year. The decline in the use of support,
however, has not occurred across all financial institutions. There is indeed evidence of
multiple tiers at least in the US market, as some financial institutions continue to depend on
government guarantees to issue debt. This has become evident since the second half of last
year, as a subset of banks stopped issuing government-guaranteed bonds, whereas these
instruments still made up a third of the new issuance for others. Going forward, wholesale
guarantee schemes will likely close down in a few more countries, although previously
guaranteed debt will remain a sovereign contingent liability until maturity.
31.
Deposit insurance schemes have not undergone significant changes since their
expansion at the beginning of the crisis. Most of these plans for temporary or special
protection of deposits are due to expire between 2010 and 2013, with the majority occurring
in 2010 and 2011. In October 2009, the US extended the temporary increase in the deposit
insurance (which was to expire at the end of 2009) through the end of 2013. Other G-20
jurisdictions have not yet announced specific plans.
32.
Capital support schemes have also been extended in several instances, but actual
capital injections have been modest lately. Several recapitalization schemes that were
supposed to expire at the end of 2009 have been extended for periods ranging between six
and twelve months. Austria (on a reduced budget allocation basis) and Greece all lengthened
their bank recapitalization schemes for another six months, whereas Germany’s facility was
extended for another year until the end of 2010. In the US, the Capital Purchase Program
(CPP) ended on December 31, 2009, as planned. Actual capital injections have slowed down

19
markedly since their peak in late 2008, and new flows (net of divestments) in the first months
of 2010 have been negligible, leaving outlays well below the pledged amounts for capital
injections. These developments reflect enhanced stabilization of the financial system,
although further possible write-down and growing nonperforming loans, could lead to greater
fund raising needs that may not be absorbed entirely by the market.

Advanced
economies
Australia

As the economy recovers, return budget to surplus by: allowing expected
improvements in tax receipts to flow to the budget bottom line; and, when
the economy is expected to grow at above-trend rates, restraining real
growth in spending to 2 per cent a year until budget returns to surplus.

Canada

Return to balanced budget by 2014-15 through a winding down of the
crisis Action Plan and restraint on direct program spending.

France

Reduce deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2013 through revenue and spending
measures and structural reforms. Revenue measures include increased taxes
in the social security budget and reversal of 2010 revenue loss due to the
abolition of the local business tax. Limit on real spending of 0.9 percent per
year after 2010.

Germany

Consolidation to start in 2011, in line with SGP (deficit of 3 percent or less
by 2013) and constitutional rule (0.35 percent of GDP federal structural
deficit by 2016 and balanced state-level structural budgets by 2020).
Consolidation program will be predominantly expenditure based, but no
concrete measures announced. Income tax reform under consideration.

Italy

Gradual consolidation in line with SGP.

Japan

Announcement of a medium-term fiscal framework expected in the first
half of 2010.

Korea

Fiscal consolidation envisaged through 2013, largely driven by expenditure
measures such as suspension or downsizing of temporary projects as well
as better prioritization. Tax measures planned, including some reduction in
extensive allowances and incentives for CIT and PIT, increases in social
security contributions, and higher environmental taxes. Further tax cuts
planned, including additional targeted tax incentives and final stage of
postponed rate cuts for the highest CIT and PIT brackets.

United
Kingdom

Tax and spending measures to reduce public sector borrowing through
2013-14. Announced revenue measures include increases in some income
tax rates, National Insurance contributions, and excises. Spending measures
include limits to growth of public sector pay and pensions.

United States

Budget proposals include a 3-year freeze on non-security discretionary
spending, fully repayment of TARP, allowing the 2001-03 tax cuts to
expire for high-income households, and eliminating funding for inefficient
fossil fuel subsidies.

21
Emerging
economies
Argentina

Growth recovery and functioning of automatic stabilizers.

Brazil

Growth recovery and functioning of automatic stabilizers. Return to precrisis fiscal targets in 2010, although public investment will remain high
under the Growth Acceleration Program and related to the 2012 World Cup
and 2016 Olympic Games.

China

Withdrawal of stimulus and growth recovery.

India

Gradual consolidation envisaged through 2012, with measures to raise
voluntary tax compliance and reduce tax exemptions.

Indonesia

Gradual consolidation through 2014, with reforms to modernize tax
administration and enhance collections and increase oil and gas production.
Expenditure-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase gradually to support
economic development and poverty reduction.

Mexico

Adjustment starts in 2010 with a tax package of 1 percent of GDP,
including an increase of VAT, excise, and income tax rates. The authorities
aim to return debt ratio to a declining trend by 2011 and the fiscal balance,
as defined under the fiscal rule, to zero by 2012.

Russia

Unwinding of large anti-crisis package in 2010-11, lower spending on
public administration and low-priority infrastructure projects, and higher
social security contributions.

Saudi Arabia

Fiscal policy influenced by recovery of oil prices. Aim to save sufficient oil
revenues to enable countercyclical action and to preserve intergenerational
equity. Spending is expected to remain elevated to support medium term
social and infrastructure initiatives.

South Africa

Fiscal deficit widening mainly due to automatic stabilizers and ongoing
infrastructure program (World Cup, transport and energy). Deficit expected
to narrow significantly as economy recovers and investment program
winds down.

Turkey

Some exit measures implemented in 2009 (increases in excise taxes and
reversal of reduced rates on VAT and special consumption tax), with
additional measures introduced early 2010 (including further excise
increases and controls on health spending) to achieve 2010 Medium-Term
Plan target. Plan targets gradual fiscal adjustment during 2010-12 mainly
through higher revenue, cost containment, and fiscal rule..
