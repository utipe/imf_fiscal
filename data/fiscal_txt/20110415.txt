EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The recovery is gaining strength, but output gaps and unemployment remain high in advanced
economies, while new macroeconomic risks are building in emerging economies.


In G-20 advanced economies, the recovery is becoming more self-sustained. Growth will,
however, remain too low to substantially reduce output gaps and still-high unemployment,
reflecting the continuing impact of pre-crisis imbalances (e.g., housing) and crisis-related
damage (e.g., financial systems and fiscal positions).



In G-20 emerging economies, growth is expected to remain robust, in part reflecting limited
damage from the crisis. However, inflationary pressures are building, and there are signs of
overheating and nascent credit booms in a number of economies.



All countries face a new challenge of higher commodity prices, which have increased due to
strong demand and supply uncertainties. This is leading to higher headline inflation.

Financial risks have eased, but new risks have emerged.


Slow growth and inadequate policy responses in advanced economies will keep fiscal positions
and financial systems vulnerable to shocks, especially in peripheral Europe, but also elsewhere.



In some emerging economies, credit booms and overheating threaten eventual hard landings.



Oil and food prices remain subject to supply uncertainty and upside price risks.

Key policy challenges are to strengthen growth in advanced economies, moderate growth in
emerging economies, and reduce risks.


In advanced economies, financial sector repair and reform, notably in the euro area, should
proceed expeditiously. Articulation of clear and credible medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans remains an urgent priority, particularly in the United States. Monetary policy should
remain accommodative—including to absorb the first-round inflation effects of higher
commodity prices—but nimble to respond quickly if the risks of second-round effects rise.



In emerging economies, the challenge is to avoid overheating in the face of closing output gaps
and higher capital flows. The policy response should be twofold. First, to rely on a combination
of fiscal consolidation and higher interest rates to maintain output at potential. Second, to use
macro-prudential tools, including, where appropriate, capital controls, to avoid increases in
systemic risk stemming from inflows. The exchange rate appreciation that may result is part of
the desirable adjustment, increases real income, and should not be resisted.



The global macro policy agenda for the world remains the same, but with the passage of time,
more urgent. For the recovery to be sustained, advanced countries must achieve fiscal
consolidation. To do so and maintain growth, they need to rely more on external demand.
Symmetrically, emerging economies must rely less on external demand and more on domestic
demand. Appreciation of emerging economies’ currencies relative to advanced economies’
currencies is an important part of this adjustment.

2

I. A BROADER BUT STILL MULTISPEED RECOVERY1
The recovery is broadening as accommodative macroeconomic policies, improving financial
conditions, and building confidence support private demand and offset the waning effects of
the inventory cycle. Divergence in economic performance remains wide, however. In
advanced economies, growth is gaining some momentum but remains too low to substantially
reduce output gaps and unemployment. In emerging economies, growth is robust and there
are signs of overheating in some countries. Financial conditions have eased, but stress
remains elevated in the euro area. Oil and food prices have risen sharply, due to strong
structural and cyclical demand and supply uncertainties.
A. Activity to strengthen at varying speeds
1.
The recovery is developing as
anticipated and broadening. World growth
decelerated to about 3¾ percent during the second
half of 2010, from about 5¼ percent during the
first half, while risks of a “double-dip” recession
in advanced economies receded. The recovery has
broadened as the inventory cycle has moderated,
with accommodative policies, improving financial
conditions, and building confidence supporting
investment and consumption activity. Recently,
leading activity indicators have recovered from the
soft patch in the fall and global trade growth has
picked up strongly.

2.
In advanced economies the recovery is
proceeding too slowly. Output gaps remain wide,
although economic slack in some economies—including Australia and Germany—is
disappearing more rapidly.


1

The United States continues to recover gradually, supported by easing financial
conditions, increased traction in private demand, and a stronger contribution from net
exports. But improvement in the housing and labor markets has been slow and
without a further rebalancing from domestic to external demand, growth will remain
subdued and the large output gap will persist for some time.



In Japan, recovery has been set back by the recent tragic earthquake. It is difficult to
assess its economic impact at this time, but assuming that power shortages and the
nuclear issue are resolved within a few months, and government programs to repair
damage are deployed rapidly, growth could slow during 2011 to 1.4 percent, about
0.2 percentage points below previous projections. However, uncertainties remain
large and risks are tilted to the downside. The key spillover is through Japan’s role in
the global supply chain in some sectors, especially in automobiles and electronics.



In the euro area, despite lingering financial tensions, growth has strengthened and
become increasingly underpinned by private demand. Unemployment remains high,
however, and there is substantial variation in growth across countries. In particular,
while there is a substantial degree of slack in the periphery, the output gap is closing
more rapidly in the core economies, especially in Germany.

3.
In emerging economies, expansion is underway as output gaps in many
economies have closed, but the policy response is lagging.


Broad-based recovery is continuing in emerging Asian economies, supported by
strong export performance, buoyant private domestic demand, and rapid credit
growth. Growth has moderated from cyclical highs but remains rapid and emerging
Asia continues to outpace other regions. Output gaps have mostly closed.



Other emerging G-20 economies, including those in Latin America, continue to
recover strongly and must now contend with the policy challenges of managing high
commodity prices and strong capital inflows, notwithstanding their recent moderation
In some cases, including Brazil, overheating is a risk. In other, slower-growing
countries that did not emerge as rapidly from the global recession, including Mexico
and South Africa, there are signs that output is moving closer to potential.



The policy response to overheating risks remains inadequate, with real policy rates
remaining negative across many emerging economies and fiscal balances appreciably
below precrisis levels.

Labor market conditions contrast sharply, reflecting the divergence in economic
growth performance. In some advanced economies, especially in the United States and
large parts of the euro area, unemployment remains well above pre-crisis levels and is
declining only gradually. Germany is an exception as the unemployment rate has recently
fallen to its lowest level in almost two decades. In many of the major emerging economies
outside central and Eastern Europe and the CIS, unemployment rates are below precrisis
levels. Notwithstanding buoyant labor market conditions, high youth unemployment remains
a broad concern across many economies.

Inflation pressures are broadening in emerging economies but remain checked in
advanced economies.


Headline inflation in emerging economies is now running at over 6 percent, up from
4¾ percent in late 2009. Over the same period, core inflation increased to 3½ percent,
up from 1¾ percent, suggesting that inflation pressures are broad and reflect
tightening capacity constraints, and not just higher commodity prices. In a number of
the larger economies, headline inflation is running close to or above central bank
targets.



In some advanced economies in Europe, headline inflation has increased sharply
although core inflation has remained subdued, financial markets have moved to pricein interest rate hikes by the middle of 2011.

B. Financial conditions ease, but stress persists
6.
Financial conditions eased during late 2010 and indicators of uncertainty remain
well below mid-2010 levels, despite some increase in response to the Japanese
earthquake and oil market developments. However, progress in financial system repair
and reform are lagging behind improvements in the economy, while accommodative
monetary conditions and rising risk appetite may be masking underlying vulnerabilities.


Conditions eased during the second half of 2010 and into early 2011, as advanced
economy equity prices gained and credit spreads tightened in response to the broad
pick-up in economic indicators and improving corporate earnings. Some euro area
markets were exceptions to this broad easing, with sovereign periphery (and some
core) and bank CDS spreads either remaining wide or widening further, underscoring
the extent to which sovereign and banks risks remain intertwined.



Bank lending conditions are easing
gradually in advanced economies, but
still remain tight, likely reflecting capital
rebuilding and tighter supervision and
regulation. This is contributing to weak
private credit growth. In contrast, credit
growth in many emerging economies is
rising rapidly and reaching levels that, in
the past, have foreshadowed the build-up
of financial imbalances and
vulnerabilities. Corporate leverage is
rising and less creditworthy borrowers
have been issuing debt in some of these
economies.



Volatility increased modestly across a broad range of asset classes due to higher
uncertainty stemming from the developments in Japan and the MENA region. More
recently, indicators of financial market uncertainty, such as the VIX, have resumed
their decline and remain well below crisis peaks and levels reached during mid-2010.

7.
The euro area took important steps to strengthen crisis management, policies,
and governance. Specifically:


Crisis management. Policy makers are committed to increasing the effective lending
capacity of the EFSF to €440 bn and the ESM to €500 bn, through a range of funding
mechanisms, including guarantees. ESM loans will now follow IMF pricing
principles. Loan conditions for Greece were relaxed, but left unchanged for Ireland.
Decisions to provide financing under the ESM will be taken by unanimity in the
Eurogroup, after a debt sustainability assessment which will involve the IMF.2 All
countries restated their commitment to a set of credible bank stress tests coupled with
follow-up plans to deal with vulnerabilities.



Economic Coordination and governance. Euro area leaders agreed to go beyond
existing surveillance arrangements with concrete annual commitments in the areas of
collective bargaining, labor taxes, business environment, pension and health care,
fiscal frameworks and financial regulation. European leaders also endorsed legislative
proposals to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, enhance coordination through
the European Semester, and introduce macroeconomic surveillance.

2

Other notable features include: private sector involvement in the context of ESM loans, which will remain an
action of last resort, decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with IMF policies; the introduction of collective
actions clauses starting in June 2013; and the granting of preferred creditor status to ESM loans.

Box 1. Credit Boom Risks in Emerging Economies
Signs of nascent credit booms in some emerging G-20 economies—if not addressed by
appropriate policy responses—may portend risks of eventual financial crises and hard landings
for economic growth. Credit booms have been linked to recent banking crises, including Asia in the
late 1990s, and emerging Europe and the U.S. subprime market during 2007-08. It is difficult, exante, to identify whether a credit boom is “good” (reflecting needed financial deepening) or “bad”
(driven by excesses), but history provides some guidance. In particular, “bad” booms tend to be:
larger and longer; associated with higher inflation and/ or rapid property price increases; and
accompanied by widening current account deficits. Notable current examples of especially rapid
credit growth, interrupted only briefly by the financial crisis, include Brazil, China (and Hong
Kong SAR), and Turkey.
In Brazil, easy external financing conditions and rapid credit growth are contributing to
overheating pressures. The current account deficit is widening despite terms of trade gains for
commodity exporters and inflation is picking up. There is scope to continue with the monetary

policy tightening cycle, while the substantial recent fiscal consolidation measures should
gradually take hold. Brazil has been active in adopting macro-prudential instruments, including by
increasing reserve requirements and tightening FX borrowing limits.
In China, tighter policies have begun to slow credit growth after a rapid expansion in 2009-10.
Vulnerabilities and imbalances may build if credit growth picks up again, including an eventual
deterioration in credit quality, an increased risk of a property bubble, and an expansion of inflationary
pressures. To restrain credit growth, there should be less reliance on quantitative limits and reserve
requirements and a greater burden placed on higher interest rates.
In Turkey, booming credit is being accompanied by evidence of building vulnerabilities,
including a large rise in short-term external debt flows and a widening current account deficit.
Measures to rein in credit growth have included raising reserve requirements, reducing carry trade
incentives by lowering the policy rate, prudential measures (e.g., LTV ceilings) and higher taxes on
non-residential loans. The impact of these measures has been somewhat muted because, among other
reasons, higher reserve requirements have been largely neutralized by the lower policy rate.

After rising rapidly, capital flows to emerging economies have moderated but
remain relatively high and volatile.


In recent months, capital inflows have moderated and even reversed in some cases.
This could reflect a confluence of factors, including increasing inflation concerns,
with local currency yield curve steepening observed in some key markets, and
renewed investor interest in advanced markets after a run of emerging market
outperformance that pushed equity and bond valuations to relatively high levels.



Emerging economies have addressed capital inflows, to varying degrees, with a
combination of macroeconomic policies as well as prudential and capital control
measures. However, policymakers in a number of emerging economies are relying
more on prudential and control measures, while delaying the needed macroeconomic
policy response.

emerging Asia generally compete more
directly with China in third markets than Latin American countries, and the fear of
being ‘priced out’ of these markets in Asia is likely providing an incentive to limit
appreciation against the Chinese renminbi.



In contrast, some commodity exporters with floating exchange rates, such as Brazil
and South Africa, have seen their currencies appreciate substantially in nominal
effective terms since early 2009, boosting real exchange rates to levels that look
overvalued from a medium-term perspective. The effect of this real appreciation on
external accounts has been offset, in part, by strong gains in commodity prices over
the past year that have supported export incomes.



The real effective values of the euro and the Japanese yen are broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals, while the U.S. dollar remains on the strong side of

fundamentals. Some further real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
undervalued currencies would help ensure a sustained decline of the U.S. current
account deficit towards a level more consistent with medium-term fundamentals,
helping to support more balanced growth.
C. Oil and food prices are higher as supply uncertainties increase

Unanticipated supply setbacks in oil and food commodity markets have added to
upward price pressures from strong cyclical forces and long-term structural changes.
Commodity markets have recovered more rapidly since early 2009 than during previous
cyclical recoveries and prices remain high in real terms.


Long-term structural change partly explains rising prices, with rapid commodityintensive growth and a rising middle class in emerging economies boosting demand
for a broad range of commodities.

costs and scarcity.

Oil prices have more recently risen due to some supply disruptions and
increased supply risks. Unrest in some Middle East and North African (MENA) oil
producing countries is affecting oil exports and raising concern about possible spillovers to
other major exporters.


Libyan production declines equivalent to 1½ percent of global supply have been
broadly offset by higher production in other OPEC members, notably Saudi Arabia.
The Libyan supply setback is comparable to developments around the time of the Iraq
war of 2003, but considerably below earlier supply shocks.



World oil prices have risen by about 20 percent since mid-February. The Average
Petroleum Spot Price (APSP) has reached about $119 per barrel, compared to the
average of $79 for 2010. Compared to previous supply shocks of similar magnitude,
the price response is so far modest.

11

12.
Global food commodity prices have risen sharply over recent months and are
now trading close to their 2008 peaks. Price increases have been broad-based and led by
grains prices. The catalyst has been a series of weather-related supply shocks in key crops
which hit food markets when the process of rebuilding inventory levels—run down during
the 2002–08 period—had only just begun. Food demand has also continued to grow robustly,
with emerging economies, including China, accounting for 70–80 percent of demand growth
during the 2008–10 period.
13.
Trade and bio-fuel policies have contributed to recent food price volatility. In
response to supply shortfalls in 2010, Russia and other CIS countries restricted grain exports
to stabilize domestic markets, likely amplifying the world price response. Policy support for
bio-fuel production and consumption remains important in some economies, including the
United States, the European Union, Brazil, and to some extent in India. Some efforts have
been made to minimize the effects on food production, but land and crop usage for feedstock
is increasing—for instance, the share of the global corn crop used as ethanol feedstock tripled
to 15 percent between 2005–10.

II. IMPROVED PROSPECTS BUT NEW RISKS EMERGE
Prospects for the recovery through 2011–12 have improved, but progress in global
rebalancing, key for a sustained, healthy recovery, will be limited. Some risks have eased,
but elevated financial stress in the euro area periphery and higher oil and food prices
represent near-term threats to stability and growth. The potential for eventual hard landings
in emerging economies has also increased. Weak sovereign balance sheets in advanced
economies continue to threaten prospects for sustainable growth.
Prospects have improved for 2011–12, but demand rebalancing will be limited.
14.
Improving financial conditions, ongoing growth momentum in emerging
economies, and building confidence in advanced economies should underpin the global
recovery. Global growth is projected to moderate somewhat to about 4½ percent in 2011
from about 5 percent in 2010, with advanced economies expanding by about 2½ percent. The
driving forces of ongoing recovery in advanced economies are anticipated to continue
shifting from restocking and policy stimulus to private demand, including investment—
supported by diminishing excess capacity, easing financial conditions, healthy nonfinancial
corporate balance sheets and cashflow—and consumption as employment and confidence
gradually recover.
15.
Growth in emerging economies is
expected to moderate but remain sufficiently
strong to keep output at or above potential on
average. Real GDP is expected to expand by
about 6½ percent in 2011 compared to
7¼ percent in 2010. Recovery momentum is
being boosted by a range of factors, including
rising exports, accommodative macroeconomic
policies, capital flows and higher commodity
prices. Rapid credit growth, despite some efforts
to tighten policies, and strong labor market
conditions are also expected to underpin
domestic demand.

Notwithstanding divergences in growth and output gaps that call for
differentiated policy settings, macroeconomic policies are anticipated to remain broadly
accommodative across advanced and emerging economies.


In advanced economies, the scale of monetary tightening is generally expected to be
modest. The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan are forecast to keep their interest
rates very low during 2011, due to subdued wage claims and large output gaps. The
ECB increased its rates for the first time since the crisis in April, as it sees growing

14

upside risks to price stability, but it has prolonged unconventional support in
recognition of still high financial risks. Economic conditions and underlying price
pressures will be somewhat stronger in various other advanced economies—including
Australia and Korea—and they will have to do more as domestic demand rises and
food and energy prices put pressure on wages. In the United States, the extent of nearterm fiscal adjustment remains unclear, while in Europe fiscal policy is tightening. In
Japan, the immediate fiscal priority will be to facilitate needed reconstruction
spending to restore growth.


In emerging economies, despite tightening capacity constraints, rapid credit growth
and rising core inflation, monetary policy tightening, particularly rate hikes, is
anticipated to be limited. Fiscal consolidation is expected to accelerate in 2011. The
average headline deficit is projected to fall by more than 1¼ percent of GDP (about
1 percent of GDP in cyclically adjusted terms). The pace of consolidation appears to
fall short of what would be warranted by cyclical developments, with cyclically
adjusted primary balances often projected to be substantially weaker than before the
outset of the crisis

Progress in rebalancing the global economy will be modest. Policymakers have yet
to put in place credible plans to achieve rebalancing.



Many of the distortions underlying the large
pre-crisis imbalances remain—including
undervalued exchange rates in key emerging
surplus economies and insufficient domestic
saving in advanced deficit economies. This
will contribute to a broad deterioration in
existing external imbalances across the G-20
and these trends, if left unchecked, present a
medium-term threat to global growth
prospects.

Previously highlighted risks have eased, but new risks have emerged
18.
Financial risks have declined, but slow growth in advanced economies will keep
financial systems and fiscal positions vulnerable to shocks. Near-term risks are greatest in
Europe, where the threat of spillovers from the euro area periphery to core European
economies remains significant. Broadening economic recovery and accommodative
macroeconomic and financial policies are easing balance sheet risks and boosting risk
appetite in the euro area, but vulnerabilities remain broad and deep. Markets remain
uncertain about the exact mechanisms to resolve funding stress quickly without spillovers.
Risks are exacerbated by continuing weakness among many financial institutions in Europe,
lack of clarity on their exposures, and weak sovereign balance sheets.

16

Box 2. Low Capital Buffers and Vulnerabilities in European Banks
Markets are concerned that some banks are too highly leveraged given the uncertainty about the
quality of assets that they hold. For example, staff calculations indicate that over 5 percent of banks,
representing 2 percent of bank assets, in a sample of more than 80 EU institutions, had Core Tier
1 ratios below 6 percent at end-2010. This figure rises to over 30 percent of banks and almost
20 percent of assets against an 8 percent Core Tier 1 ratio. Some weakly capitalized banks have found
it difficult to finance themselves in the market and have turned in varying degrees to central banks for
liquidity support. This weak tail of banks has created overcapacity in some banking systems, raising
funding costs for all banks in the system, reducing profitability, and adversely affecting capital
generation.
To restore investor confidence and sustain cost effective access to funding markets, banks need to
raise the quantity and quality of their capital buffers. At the same time, further policy action is
needed to restructure and, where necessary, resolve this weak tail of undercapitalized banks and to
restore overall banking system health. Banks should also take measures to address uncertainty about
asset quality. One way is to increase transparency by enhancing the frequency and quality of EU bank
reporting, for example through all institutions reporting a common template that is publically
disclosed on a quarterly basis. The publication of stress-test results can also make an important
contribution to greater transparency.
There is an opportunity to improve on the 2010 stress tests run by the Committee of European
Banking Supervisors when new stress tests are conducted by the European Banking Authority later in
2011. These new stress tests should: be embedded in a broader crisis management strategy, including
the clarification of support for sovereigns and backstops for banks; ensure the broadest possible
coverage of banks in each country; incorporate funding costs and liquidity strains; have a more
stringent capital hurdle, especially for banks that rely on wholesale funding markets; include ex ante
verification of weak assets—particularly real estate—by private consultants for loan books in
economies with property overhangs; have stronger supervisory scrutiny to ensure consistency across
economies; and require upfront and higher quality capitalization for weaker banks.

In emerging economies, tightening capacity constraints and overheating threaten
an eventual hard landing. Inflation pressures are broadening in emerging economies due to
tight capacity constraints and could become ingrained in inflation expectations. At the same
time, risks of overheating are rising, due to credit booms, rising corporate leverage, and
capital inflows. Policy responses, so far, have been insufficient to address these rising
pressures, portending risks of a hard landing.
20.
The risk of a near-term spike in oil
prices back to 2008 peaks has increased
materially. Oil demand growth is expected to
moderate from the strong expansion in 2010, but
remain robust. Prices will also depend importantly
on OPEC production. The call on OPEC (global
demand minus non-OPEC supply) will likely
increase markedly in 2011. At the same time, the
earthquake in Japan may increase oil demand
gradually, due to reconstruction and substitution
away from nuclear power generation. Futures
markets anticipate a very gradual reduction in oil
supply uncertainty, through 2011, with the
implied probability of prices reaching the 2008
high of about $145 per barrel increasing since the
start of 2011, in part reflecting unrest in MENA
and the threat of spillovers to other oil exporters,
but also possible supply disruptions related to
upcoming elections in Nigeria.3
21.
Food price risks are also on the upside.
Markets anticipate that improving supply should
allow prices to retreat modestly from their recent
highs through 2011, but it will take time for global
food inventories to rise to more normal levels,
which will leave food prices sensitive to shocks

economies. Gradual increases would slow investment and potential growth in advanced as
well as emerging and developing economies, making fundamental reform of entitlement
programs—indispensable to attaining sustainable public finances—even harder to achieve.
III. POLICY CHALLENGES
Policies to rebalance growth and reduce vulnerabilities are needed to sustain the global
recovery. In the advanced economies, the most pressing tasks are to alleviate financial
stresses, notably in some euro area countries, and accelerate financial reforms. Credible
medium-term fiscal consolidation plans are also required, particularly in the United States
and Japan. The key policy challenge in emerging economies is to address overheating and
rising inflation, and prevent the build-up of financial imbalances. In key surplus economies,
currency appreciation can contribute to reduced overheating, facilitating a healthy
rebalancing from external to internal demand.
23.
Clearer parameters for the crisis management mechanisms in the euro area are
certainly welcome but challenges now lie in their implementation.


The funding mechanism for the larger effective EFSF should be clarified as soon as
possible. A decision on adapting the interest rate charged on EFSF loans is also
urgently needed to help support fiscal sustainability.

19



The interdependence of national banking systems and sovereigns remain
unaddressed, and the onus of dealing with financial sector issues is squarely left on
the national authorities, despite the high potential for cross-border contagion.



Added flexibility on the instruments of the proposed permanent facility beyond 2013
would help broaden the avenues of support and bolster the emphasis on prevention
and early action. This would strengthen the extent to which the new facility provides
a robust and orderly framework to assist euro area members, with strict conditionality
to support discipline

24.
In advanced economies, financial repair and reform need to move forward to
sustain the recent improvement in financial conditions. There has not been enough
emphasis on structural measures that more directly facilitate a sustained normalization of
financial conditions.


Bank capital buffers still remain too low, notably in the euro area banks, and
policymakers need to facilitate reduced uncertainty about bank balance sheets. This
will require greater disclosure about asset quality and exposures and rigorous,
credible, and timely stress tests that assess solvency and funding risks, backed by
capital support or followed by resolution, if necessary. Implementation of the new
Basel III accord should be accelerated.



The post-crisis supervisory and regulatory architecture is still a work in progress.
The shadow banking system and institutions that are too large, or too complex, to fail
pose problems that has not yet been fully addressed. Stronger supervision and
resolution frameworks are needed for cross-border financial institutions. This will
require significantly enhanced international cooperation, including in day-to-day
supervision. System-wide macroprudential policy frameworks also require
development and implementation.



Restarting private securitization is critical to repairing credit intermediation. In the
United States, a return to robust mortgage securitization would depend on greater
clarity about forthcoming changes in the housing financing system. These would
include clarifying the role of government sponsored enterprises, reforms of rating
agencies, and better incentives to safe securitization.

25.
Emerging economies need to address overheating and credit boom risks. To
mitigate the risks of an eventual hard landing, policymakers in some countries have relied too
much on prudential and control measures, delaying the macroeconomic policy response, and
threatening inflation and financial stability and policy credibility. There remains a need to:


Tighten monetary policy and, notably in key surplus economies, allow for greater
exchange rate flexibility. Notwithstanding recent rate hikes in some emerging

20

economies, real interest rates remain far below precrisis levels and hence too low.
Greater exchange rate appreciation would dampen inflationary pressures, including
from world commodity prices, introduce more two-way risk for capital inflows, and
facilitate external rebalancing in surplus economies.


Accelerate fiscal consolidation. Current projections are for a limited decline in budget
deficits of emerging economies in 2011 and 2012, even though output growth and
capacity utilization would continue to be above pre-crisis trend. In external deficit
economies, fiscal tightening would take some of the adjustment burden from
monetary policy and the exchange rate, and allow for lower interest rates, all else
equal, which could rebuild policy space, restrain widening current account deficits,
and reduce net capital inflow pressures.



Manage capital flows by fully utilizing macroeconomic and prudential tools, tailored
to country-specific circumstances. If inflows raise macro- and financial-stability
concerns, macroeconomic policies (e.g., adjusting the fiscal-monetary policy mix,
exchange rate appreciation, and some reserve accumulation) should be complemented
with strengthened prudential measures (e.g., loan to value ratios, funding composition
restrictions). Capital controls can be used in some cases, but they should not
substitute for necessary macroeconomic and prudential policies.

26.
Central banks should accommodate higher food and energy prices so long as it
does not threaten policy credibility and underlying inflation.


In advanced economies, the scope for accommodation is greater due to a relatively
small share of food and energy in the consumer basket, well-anchored inflation
expectations, and excess capacity that will exert downward pressure on wages.
However, even economies with well-established inflation targeting regimes may need
to gradually normalize policy rates from very low levels to guard against the possible
second round effects of persistent commodity price shocks, particularly as excess
capacity gradually disappears.



In emerging economies, monetary policy may need to respond more sensitively to
first-round inflation shocks from higher commodity prices due to higher pass-through
(mainly for food prices, less so for energy), less well-anchored inflation expectations,
and economies that are operating closer to, or above, capacity.

27.
The rapid increase in food prices may incur fiscal and social costs, particularly
in emerging and low income countries (LICs). To minimize these costs, policymakers
would need to:


Avoid distortionary policies, such as trade restrictions, excessive hoarding of food
inventories by state-owned reserve managers, price controls, and poorly targeted

21

subsidy programs that seek to insulate domestic markets, as such actions can increase
world food price volatility and dampen the domestic supply response;


Ensure that the poor are protected, ideally through targeted and cost-effective social
safety net programs. The IMF also stands ready to boost its financial support to LICs
and other member countries to help them stem the adverse effects of rapid food price
increases.

28.
Substantial fiscal consolidation in many advanced economies is in the pipeline,
but clear and credible medium-term fiscal consolidation frameworks need to be in place
as soon as possible, particularly in the United States where the crisis has worsened debt
dynamics on top of long-term pressures from entitlement spending. Medium-term fiscal
adjustment needs in emerging economies are generally smaller.


Deficits in most advanced economies remain well above the levels that would
stabilize or reduce debt ratios. In particular, to reduce debt ratios to the precrisis
median of 60 percent of GDP (net debt of 80 percent for Japan), the average projected
adjustment of 3¾ percent of GDP between 2010 and 2016 amounts to less than half
that needed through 2020.



Adjustment needs in emerging economies average about 2 percent of GDP (one
quarter the average for advanced economies), based on an illustrative scenario that
would reduce the debt ratio gradually to 40 percent of GDP or stabilize it at the
projected 2012 level, if below 40 percent of GDP.4

29.
The key principles underlying fiscal consolidation plans, which may vary by
country, should include:


Flexible responses to macroeconomic conditions. In all advanced economies,
additional revenues from faster-than-anticipated growth should be saved. Emerging
economies should use revenue buoyancy related to high asset and commodity prices
and favorable economic conditions to rebuild fiscal buffers rather than increase
spending in the near term.



Deep entitlement reforms in advanced economies, particularly in health care, where
policymakers will have to balance the need to ensure access with the requirement of
maintaining sustainability of public finances. In emerging economies, the challenge
will be to improve the coverage of health safety nets while preserving long-term
fiscal sustainability, as health indicators are substantially lower than in advanced
countries.



Revenue measures in economies where adjustment needs are large and/ or revenue
ratios are low. Raising revenue by widening tax bases and removing distortions,
rather than by raising tax rates, should be part of the adjustment package in some
economies. In many countries, the elimination of tax expenditures can contribute to
this objective.



Developing good fiscal institutions that can provide accurate and timely monitoring
of fiscal outturns, better coordination across levels of government, and more mediumterm orientation of fiscal policy making, including by establishing and strengthening
fiscal rules.
