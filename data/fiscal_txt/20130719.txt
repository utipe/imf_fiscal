GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICY CHALLENGES

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The strength of the recovery disappointed once again and the outlook has weakened somewhat. Global
growth improved from 2¼ percent (annual rate) in 2012Q4 to 2¾ percent in 2013Q1, but this was weakerthan-projected in the April WEO. The July WEO outlook is for lower growth in both 2013 and 2014, reflecting
inter alia a (once again) delayed recovery in the euro area, as well as weaker growth in emerging economies.
Market volatility has been higher and financial conditions have tightened. Higher volatility following a
strong market rally may stem from several possible sources, including some asset re-pricing following strong
gains, uncertainty about tapering of U.S monetary stimulus; and market reassessment of emerging economy
fundamentals. After a bout of disappointing data on emerging markets activity and following Fed’s signals
that quantitative easing could be tapered earlier than expected, volatility and bonds yields have increased;
and emerging market equities and currencies have fallen sharply, alongside capital outflows and liquidity
pressures. Emerging economies with poor fundamentals and strong previous capital inflows have been
hardest hit. In advanced economies, longer-term interest rates and financial volatility have increased and
sovereign spreads in the euro area periphery have been widening, following a period of continued declines.
While tail risks have abated, important downside risks prevail. Although it is too soon to tell, the current
market turbulence could continue and deepen. Growth could be lower than projected due to a protracted
period of stagnation in the euro area, and risks of a longer slowdown in emerging markets have increased.
Additionally, financial stability risks are a growing concern in both advanced and emerging economies. The
eventual exit from low rates and unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies could pose
challenges for emerging economies, especially if it proceeds too fast or is not well communicated.
Progress on the policy front is crucial to achieve a stronger and lasting recovery, while safeguarding
financial stability. Specifically:


Advanced economies should pursue a policy mix that is more supportive of near-term growth than in the
recent past, differentiated according to fiscal space, and anchored by a credible and concrete roadmap to
achieve fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy should continue to play its supportive role, given low
inflation and economic slack. Fiscal adjustment should proceed gradually, anchored by credible and
detailed medium-term plans with emphasis on “growth-friendly” adjustment. Financial sector reforms are
imperative, notably in Europe, where further progress in restructuring, resolving, and recapitalizing banks
and completing the banking union is critical to allow a revival of credit to the real economy.



Emerging economies now need to navigate carefully through more turbulent waters. Monetary easing can
alleviate liquidity pressures and downside risks to growth but capital outflows may complicate actions.
Policymakers should be ready to address possible financial stability risks where high credit growth has
been prolonged, by strengthening oversight and macro-prudential policies. Risk of lower potential
suggests less room for fiscal accommodation and policymakers should focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers,
while addressing structural obstacles to continued high potential growth.



Reducing global imbalances while supporting growth will require surplus economies to increase internal
demand on a sustained basis and deficit economies to raise external competitiveness. Without policy
progress on this front, the risks are that either global imbalances could widen again as output gaps in
advanced economies are closed or global growth would remain sluggish.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
Global growth has been weaker than expected. This reflects a delayed recovery in the euro area and
a general loss of momentum in emerging economies due to both demand and supply factors.
Accordingly, the outlook is weaker than projected in the April 2013 WEO and risks remain to the
downside. Volatility in financial markets has also increased recently, especially in emerging
economies, indicating the potential challenges that a faster-than-expected exit from low rates and
unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies could pose.

1.
Global activity has disappointed, driven by developments in the euro area and
emerging economies. Global growth increased from a 2¼ percent (annual rate) in the fourth
quarter of 2012 to 2¾ percent in the first quarter of 2013, but has been weaker than projected in
the April 2013 WEO. Recent indicators on manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales and
trade suggest that global growth in the second half of 2013 will also be softer than earlier
envisaged.

Recession in the euro area periphery has been deeper than expected and is affecting the
core, although some signs of stabilization have emerged recently. Deep fragmentation of
financial markets, the need to repair private sector balance sheets, depressed confidence
and tight fiscal conditions all continue to affect activity in the periphery. Low policy rates
are not sufficiently passing through to bank funding and lending rates and credit
continues to contract. The weakness has spilled over to core countries, also affected by
the soft patch in non-EU countries. Heightened uncertainty about euro area prospects and
policies is holding back private investment and durable consumption, even in the core.
Fiscal consolidation also had a large impact in France.



Growth disappointed across most emerging economies. Activity has generally slowed across
Asia and Latin America, reflecting both sluggish exports and revised income prospects
that are weighing on domestic demand. In some countries (Brazil, China, India), supply
factors also played a role. Growth in Emerging Asia fell to 4.8 percent (quarter-on-quarter
seasonally adjusted at annual rate; qoq saar) in 2013Q1, with manufacturing growth
weaker in China and India. Growth in Latin America slowed to 2.2 percent (qoq, saar) in
2013Q1, with growth in Brazil continuing to disappoint, although investment is finally on
the rise; and activity slowed more elsewhere (South Africa and most countries in Emerging
Europe).



In contrast, activity is expanding broadly as expected in the United States. Underlying
growth has been resilient in the face of the sharp fiscal contraction thanks to improved
private demand as the recovery in house and equity prices is strengthening household
wealth and credit conditions have eased.



Growth has surprised on the upside in Japan reflecting the new policy momentum. The new
policy strategy aimed at exiting low growth and deflation has boosted private
consumption through rising equity values and improving consumer confidence. At the
same time, exports recovered from a significant decline in the second half of 2012,
reflecting strong regional demand and a noticeably weaker yen (20 percent in real
effective terms since late 2012). First-quarter growth was stronger than expected and
inflation expectations have risen. However, investment and wages have yet to respond
and market volatility has been relatively high.

2.
Accordingly, the global outlook is for weaker near-term growth than envisaged
before. Growth is still expected to accelerate in H2 2013 but at a more gradual pace than
expected in April. Activity is projected to expand at 3.1 percent in 2013 and 3.8 percent in 2014, a
mark down of 0.2 percentage points in each year. These projections rest on the assumptions that
supportive monetary policies gain increasing traction in Europe and Japan, fiscal consolidation in
Europe and the United States are gradually de-emphasized and confidence improves. Reflecting

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the factors discussed above, prospects have deteriorated for emerging economies, where growth
is expected to rebound but to more moderate levels than previously projected, and the euro area,
which will remain in recession in 2013 and will grow at just under 1 percent in 2014, weaker than
the April WEO forecast. The outlook for commodity exporters has also deteriorated, given the
retreat in commodity prices which will keep domestic demand subdued, while the recovery will be
protracted in MENA reflecting difficult political and economic transitions (particularly for oil
importers). In the United States, prospects are also slightly weaker, as the budget sequester is now
assumed to remain in place in 2014. Japan’s growth has been revised upward this year on
stronger-than-expected Q1 growth but downward next year due to a weaker foreign
environment.


Some asset market repricing coincided with Fed
remarks about tapering. Against the backdrop of
improving fundamentals in the United States, bond
yields increased (about 50 bps since May 22), as
expectations of higher U.S. policy rates were brought
forward. With inflation expectations stable, higher real
rates implicitly are consistent with markets reassessing
the future path of Fed policy tightening. For some,
this may reflect a significant change or realization that
quantitative easing may come to an end much sooner
than expected.

Indonesia and Turkey by 250–300 basis points, in Brazil, Colombia, and South Africa by over 100
basis points). The recent decline in equity prices has been particularly sharp in Turkey (where
political events have played a role), and the South Africa Rand has weakened significantly. In
response, some countries have started intervening in the foreign exchange market and unwinding
capital flow management measures (e.g., Brazil). As U.S. interest rates continue to rise and
monetary stimulus is gradually removed, pressures for capital outflows from emerging economies
could continue.

While tails risks have abated, downside risks to growth clearly dominate. Staff’s
baseline assumes that the U.S. debt ceiling will be raised promptly and euro area authorities will
do their part to preserve confidence (a stalled or incomplete delivery of policy commitments in
the euro area could result in a re-intensification of adverse bank-sovereign-real loops). Downside
risks revolve around three key areas:


Economic Growth. There is a risk of stagnation in the euro area, especially in the
periphery, which could materialize from large or more persistent adverse effects of public
and private deleveraging, entrenched fragmentation, and delayed structural reforms
beyond what is assumed in staff projections. With sizable output gaps, negative shocks
could potentially spur adverse debt-deflation dynamics. Job skills could atrophy due to
long unemployment spells, and investment would remain subdued, reducing potential
growth. In emerging economies risks of a longer growth slowdown have risen. Activity
could fail to accelerate as expected or undergo a further deceleration if structural
problems turn out greater than expected, while capital outflows, if sustained, could weigh
on growth. Recent turbulence, liquidity pressures, and risks of overshooting in financial
markets have complicated matters although available policy space differs across countries.



Financial stability. In advanced economies, the low interest rate environment creates
risks that investors over-leverage or make excessively risky investments in search of yields.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

Financial stability risks are also a growing concern in some emerging countries (including
China) and stem from years of buoyant credit growth and growing credit intermediation
through non-banks, in some cases partly driven by spillovers from the exceptional
monetary policy easing in advanced economies. At the same time, the eventual exit from
low rates and unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies could pose
important challenges as suggested by the recent increase in financial volatility.1 While the
recent bout of market volatility follows a previous run-up in asset values, there is a risk
that markets could over-react to initial steps by the Fed towards a normalization of
monetary policy conditions, leading to sharp increases in long-term interest rates and
financial market volatility, especially for countries with higher vulnerabilities.


Fiscal balances. Finally, investors could reassess their risk perception of the United States
and Japan in light of their long-run fiscal sustainability concerns, triggering financial
turmoil with worldwide repercussions. In Japan, such a reassessment could be triggered by
a lack of a convincing debt-reduction strategy to bring down debt, in particular if the
government fails to deliver a complete package of policies including much needed
concrete fiscal measures to bring down public debt and growth-enhancing reforms. Given
the Japanese banks’ large domestic government bond holdings, an uncontrolled rise in
yields could undermine not only fiscal but also financial sector stability.

POLICIES FOR ROBUST GLOBAL GROWTH
Macroeconomic policies should remain supportive in advanced economies, with fiscal consolidation
proceeding gradually, anchored by credible and concrete medium-term plans. In a context where
risks from UMP may become non-negligible, policymakers in advanced economies should use the
breathing space from accommodation to implement decisively the difficult policies that will secure a
solid return to growth. Bank balance sheet repair and progress toward a fuller banking union in
Europe are urgently needed to revive credit and growth. Policymakers in emerging economies are
facing increasingly challenging trade-offs, having to address growth and liquidity risks while
containing building credit risk. They also should address structural obstacles to continued high
growth while rebuilding fiscal buffers.
5.
In advanced economies, macroeconomic policies should support growth. Supporting
growth and creating jobs is the main challenge in the major advanced economies. Broadly
speaking, monetary policy accommodation should continue to play its supportive role, given low
inflation and still large output gaps, and fiscal adjustment should be measured, while being
anchored by a credible medium term roadmap for sustainability. Financial sector reforms also
need to be urgently completed.

6.
The pace and composition of fiscal adjustment should be calibrated carefully to
avoid an excessive drag on growth and be anchored by credible and concrete medium-term
plans. Despite sizable consolidation efforts, fiscal imbalances remain large in advanced economies
due to weak growth and unfavorable initial fiscal positions with respect to sustainability. The
growth disappointments in turn partly reflected the negative effect of fiscal adjustment on shortterm growth and the fact that in some countries (France, Spain, UK), private demand has not been
picking up from public demand. Financial sector support measures also burdened fiscal accounts
in some countries. In the United States, while private demand has gained momentum, this year’s
large fiscal consolidation is excessive in light of the still nascent recovery. Similarly, in Japan,
despite an expansionary fiscal stance this year, substantial consolidation is in the pipeline for the
next two years as a result of the two-step increase in the consumption tax rate to 10 percent and
the waning of stimulus and reconstruction spending. In the near term, a more gradual pace of
fiscal adjustment would be preferable, but conditional on having a credible and specific medium
term consolidation plan in place. Specifically:


In the United States, the budget sequester should be replaced by a more balanced and
gradual pace of fiscal consolidation in the short term, with more efficient and targeted
spending cuts. The debt ceiling should be raised expeditiously and a multi-year
consolidation plan that tackles entitlement and tax reforms should also be adopted to
restore long-run fiscal sustainability.



In Japan, the implementation of the planned consumption tax increase next year is critical
to maintain confidence in the ability of the government to address the fiscal problem. An
ambitious and concrete consolidation plan beyond 2015, based equally on revenue and
spending, is also urgently needed. With such a plan in place, some fiscal space would be
created to smooth the fiscal adjustment in 2014–15 should growth disappoint.



In the euro area, the extension of the EDP deadlines and the assessment of adjustment in
structural terms are welcome, but the extra space should be used to act decisively on fiscal
and structural reforms. Consolidation should be based on an efficient and “growthfriendly” mix of expenditure and revenue measures, supported by appropriate structural
reforms that enhance potential growth. Spain needs a credible and detailed medium-term
plan, while France needs to rebalance adjustment toward expenditure containment. In the
United Kingdom, it is important that fiscal policy supports the nascent recovery by
pursuing fiscal measures that would alleviate supply-side constraints and also provide
support for private demand—within the context of its medium-term fiscal framework.

7.
Monetary policy needs to remain accommodative until the recovery is well
established, while containing potentially adverse side effects.


More needs to be done in the euro area, where the growth outlook is very weak,
unemployment is high, and inflation is projected well below the 2 percent target.
Conventional monetary policy should be eased further. Targeted unconventional
measures should play a role in addressing uncertainties about term funding availability for

banks and the lack of credit for nonfinancial corporations, in particular SMEs. One such
option could be a longer term LTRO combined with a review of current collateral policies,
particularly on loans to SMEs. The recent forward guidance provided by the ECB to anchor
interest rate expectations was a welcome step. The breathing space provided by
exceptionally accommodative monetary policies should be used by authorities to tackle
underlying issues that prevent a solid return to growth.

In the United States, while underlying growth has been relatively robust, there is still a long
way to go on the labor market, as unemployment remains high and labor force
participation below trends. The Fed’s policy should thus remain accommodative, including
through its UMP, as benefits still outweigh the costs. At the same time, strong prudential
oversight and supervision of the financial system is essential to address emerging
vulnerabilities in both the bank and non-bank financial sector owing to ultra low interest
rates. There are incipient signs of rising exposure to both interest rate and credit risk in
regional banks that require increased vigilance, as low interest rates squeeze interest
margins. Vulnerabilities may also be building in the non-bank financial sector, with a rapid

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

expansion of agency real estate investment trusts (REITs), weakening underwriting
standards in the leveraged loan market (covenant-lite loans issuance has returned to precrisis levels), and higher credit and liquidity risks taken by pension funds and insurance
companies. In the future, careful communication about the eventual exit from monetary
stimulus will help reduce volatility in global financial markets.
8.
Financial sector reforms need to be urgently completed. Further progress in
restructuring, resolving and recapitalizing banks and private sector balance sheets remains critical
in Europe to allow a revival of credit to the real economy. A credible and comprehensive balance
sheet assessment, with third party involvement, followed by stress tests will help identify problem
assets and quantify capital needs, and the recent agreement on the framework for ESM direct
recapitalization will help provide some backstop if implemented effectively. In parallel, the
momentum to build a banking union and thereby address architecture gaps in the euro area
needs to be maintained. Priorities include: adopting the legislation for the Single Supervisory
Mechanism (SSM), reaching final agreement by the European Parliament on the Bank Resolution
and Recovery Directive, making progress on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive, and
reaching consensus on a strong Single Resolution Authority with a centralized authority to trigger
resolution and make decision on burden sharing. Elsewhere, commitments towards regulatory
reform to enhance the stability of the financial system need to be upheld, including in the
implementation of Basel III standards, while reducing the risk of international financial regulatory
fragmentation.
9.
Policymakers in emerging economies are facing increasingly challenging trade-offs.
They need to balance support for demand and containment of liquidity risks with action to
address building credit risks. At the same time, they should rebuild fiscal space, while dealing with
structural impediments. Country circumstances vary: some may need to focus on ensuring orderly
market functioning while others will be better positioned to withstand any potential turbulence
and focus on structural reforms.


Monetary policy. Requirements differ across countries. Monetary easing can be the first
line of defense against liquidity pressures and downside risks where inflation is firmly
anchored, although capital flow reversals, external financing needs, and financial stability
risks might constrain scope for action in some countries. Monetary policy should have
some leeway to ease in emerging Asia, especially in 2014, as the output gap re-opens,
core inflation falls, and inflation expectations are well anchored. Several countries have
already cut policy rates in response to the recent weakness in activity (e.g., India, Korea). In
Latin America, economies are operating close to speed limit, which restricts available
policy room. In economies where monetary policy is still very accommodative and
inflation above target, some monetary policy tightening may be needed to bring inflation
back to target. Brazil continues to face a considerable inflation challenge, with inflation
exceeding the upper limit of the inflation target band, which requires further monetary
tightening.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Prudential policies. Policymakers should be ready to address possible financial stability
risks where high credit growth has been prolonged, by strengthening oversight and
macro-prudential policies. Steps in that direction may include countercyclical capital
requirements and dynamic provisioning. Economies faced with volatile capital flows and
financial stability risks need to consider the full range of macroeconomic and macroprudential policies to avoid excessive financial and exchange rate volatility. In particular, in
some economies, the authorities may have to ensure an orderly functioning of local bond
markets. Authorities should stand ready to offer liquidity support to bond and foreign
exchange markets, and consider the deployment of swap lines with other major central
banks. Under certain circumstances, when large and sudden outflows cause financial
instability risks or large inflows induce a sharp exchange rate appreciation or risk causing
asset price bubbles, capital flow measures may be appropriate on a temporary basis.



Fiscal and structural policies. Policymakers should also address structural obstacles to
continued high growth while rebuilding fiscal policy buffers. Public debt is above precrisis-levels in most countries and structural issues and lower potential output point to
lower fiscal space than previously estimated. Buffers should be rebuilt to create space for
action should downside risks materialize. Priority should be given to fiscal consolidation
(particularly in countries where current account deficits are widening), with monetary
policy remaining the first line of defense. In some (e.g. India), the magnitude of fiscal
problems requires an overhaul of tax and subsidy policies.

10.

reoriented somewhat toward
internal demand in a context of weak external demand, though with an excessive reliance on
investment. In contrast, the euro area current account is moving into a sizable surplus, reflecting
much narrower deficits in the periphery, the German surplus has widened, as investment has
remained very low. Accordingly, risks are that either external imbalances widen again or global
growth remains sluggish—if output gaps in advanced deficit economies are closed mainly by

internal demand; demand in key emerging economies weakens; the euro area slides into
prolonged stagnation, or the policy to break with deflation fails in Japan.
11.
Accordingly, strengthened policy action is needed to further reduce imbalances
while supporting growth. Policies need to increase internal demand on a sustained basis in
surplus economies and raise external competitiveness in deficit economies.
 Surplus economies need to increase internal demand or change its composition. In Germany,

improving the productivity of the services sector and broadening sources of financial
intermediation beyond bank-based channels could help strengthen internal demand
(especially investment), while further reforms are needed to increase the labor force. In China,
reforms to transition the economy to a more consumer-based and sustainable growth path
include financial sector reforms, strengthening the social security system, moving to a more
market-based exchange rate, opening markets to more competition, and raising resource
prices. In Japan, growth-enhancing reforms should include deregulation in domestic services
and agriculture, greater reliance on market-based financing for SMEs, and measures to reduce
duality in the labor market.
 Deficit countries should aim at increasing external competitiveness, while making further

progress on fiscal consolidation. In France and Spain, continued labor and product market
reforms would help further boost external competitiveness and narrow external deficits. In the
United Kingdom, policies need to focus on improving physical and human capital, R&D and
technology to increase the value added of exports.

1/ The quarterly estimates and projections account for 90 percent of the world purchasing-power-parity weights.
2/ The quarterly estimates and projections account for approximately 80 percent of the emerging market and developing countries.
3/ G-20 aggregations exclude European Union.
4/ The data for Argentina are officially reported data. The IMF has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on
Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the quality of the official GDP data. Alternative data sources have shown
significantly lower real growth than the official data since 2008. In this context, the IMF is also using alternative estimates of GDP
growth for the surveillance of macroeconomic developments in Argentina.
