EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global recovery is off to a stronger start than anticipated earlier, but it is
proceeding at different speeds in the various regions. Recovery in advanced economies is
being largely driven by extraordinary policy support and the turn in the inventory cycle, with
strong domestic demand and higher commodity prices adding to the growth impetus in key
emerging economies.
The speed of recovery is expected to vary considerably across G-20 countries, with
weaker and more fragile growth in advanced economies contrasting with robust expansions
in emerging economies, particularly in Asia. After contracting by 0.8 percent in 2009, global
output is expected to expand by around 4 percent in 2010 and 4.3 percent in 2011, an upward
revision of ¾ and 0.1 percentage points, respectively, relative to the October World
Economic Outlook
Risks to the outlook are on balance moderately to the downside. The most immediate risk
is intensifying market concerns about fiscal sustainability in some smaller advanced
economies, leading to contagion of rising risk premia across sovereign bond markets and
higher borrowing costs for households and companies.
A multispeed recovery means that policy challenges vary across countries. With
recovery in most advanced G-20 economies expected to be weak, policy stimulus should be
maintained at least through 2010. However, macroeconomic support cannot substitute for
restructuring in securing durable growth; in particular, financial system reform needs to
proceed with greater urgency to support aggregate credit while limiting future risks. Some
major emerging economies may have to unwind stimulus faster due to more rapid recoveries.
Policymakers need to formulate and begin to implement strategies for exiting from
crisis-related intervention policies. The appropriate timing, pace, and mode of exits depend
on the state of the economy and the health of the financial system. Expansionary fiscal policy
has a direct impact on debt, while accommodative monetary policy has no obvious direct
downside, other things remaining unchanged (e.g., the absence of price pressures in goods,
labor, and asset markets). Hence, on balance, fiscal consolidation should take priority. In
some emerging economies monetary policy may have to be tightened relatively soon and
ahead of fiscal consolidation, due to rising inflation or incipient financial vulnerabilities
Some emerging market countries will have to design policies to manage a surge of
capital inflows. The right responses differ across countries, including fiscal tightening to
ease pressure on interest rates and greater exchange rate flexibility. Macro-prudential policies
aimed at limiting the emergence of new asset price bubbles, reserves accumulation, and
carefully designed capital controls can also be part of the appropriate response in certain
circumstances.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICY CHALLENGES 1
The global recovery is off to a stronger start than anticipated earlier, but it is proceeding at
different speeds in the various regions. Following the deepest global recession in recent
history, economic growth returned and broadened to advanced economies in the second half
of 2009. In 2010, world output is expected to rise by 4 percent, an upward revision of
¾ percentage point from the October 2009 WEO. A multi-speed recovery warrants greater
differentiation in the timing and sequencing of exit from crisis-related policies. In major
advanced economies, the recovery is expected to remain sluggish by past standards. With few
clear signs of self-sustaining domestic demand, policy stimulus will need to be maintained
through 2010. In many emerging economies, activity is expected to be relatively vigorous,
largely driven by buoyant internal demand. Hence, an earlier exit from policy stimulus than
in their counterparts among the advanced economies will likely be warranted. Risks to the
outlook are on balance moderately to the downside.
I. A POLICY-DRIVEN MULTISPEED RECOVERY
1.
The global recovery accelerated and broadened during the second and third
quarters of 2009, with emerging economies continuing to contribute a large share to
overall G-20 growth. Output in the G-20 increased by about 4 percent (seasonally adjusted,
annualized) during this period, with emerging economies contributing over 80 percent of
total growth. After stabilizing in the second quarter, growth in the advanced G-20
economies reached about 2¼ percent in the third quarter. Momentum in the emerging G-20
economies has been much stronger, reaching 9 percent in the third quarter, up from
8 percent in the previous quarter. China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil continue to lead
emerging economy growth. Recovery spread in the third quarter, including to Mexico,
Russia, and South Africa.

Recovery in advanced economies is being largely driven by extraordinary policy
support and the turn in the inventory cycle, with strong domestic demand and higher
commodity prices adding to the growth impetus in key emerging economies. Policy
support has helped avoid a systemic meltdown, prompting a sooner-than-expected return of
confidence in the financial system and in the real economy, although markets’ conviction
about the sustainability of growth remains fragile. Global production and trade recovered
strongly in the second half of 2009.
•

Across advanced economies, consumption growth in the United States has been
firmer than expected, while the turn in the inventory cycle and rebounding trade have
been particularly important for the recoveries in the euro area and Japan.

•

In emerging economies, the recovery has been driven by strong domestic demand,
due in part to large, front-loaded fiscal stimulus, notably in Asia and Brazil.
Rebounding commodity prices and international trade, boosted by restocking, have
also been important, particularly for Mexico and South Africa.

Financial market conditions continue to improve, but bank credit is likely to
remain sluggish in many advanced G-20 economies, while some sovereign debt
markets are facing growing pressures. In addition, the financial sector is still benefiting
from public support, raising important questions about the timing and coordination of exits.
Consumers and SMEs may well face credit constraints going forward. Public lending

schemes and guarantees have been critical in channeling needed and safe credit to these
sectors, but have only been partially successful.
•

Bank credit will be crucial for recovery prospects. In many advanced G-20 countries,
bank balance sheet deleveraging, repair, restructuring, and recapitalization have yet to
run their course, while bank funding challenges remain. Expectations of higher
regulatory capital requirements, continuing high credit risk (for example in
commercial real estate), and worries about the sustainability of earnings (which have
thus far been supported by steep yield curves) have made banks cautious about
expanding lending. Bank lending standards remain tight, although they have shown
some recent signs of modest easing.

•

Capital markets have rebounded strongly, but vulnerabilities remain. Corporate bond
issuance has reached record levels, but has not been sufficient to offset the decline in
bank financing. Securitization is recovering, albeit in some cases due to substantial
public support.

•

Market concerns about fiscal sustainability have risen sharply in a few advanced
economies (notably Greece), increasing the risk of spillovers. This is reflected in the
rising volatility in sovereign CDS spreads or yields of some countries, notably in
Europe, as investors increasingly differentiate across countries with regard to
government deficits and debt. In part, this is due to a shift of some balance sheet
weaknesses from the private sector to the public sector. However, the global recession
and conditions in international debt markets have exacerbated underlying
vulnerabilities in the structural fiscal position of some countries. For most major
emerging economies, sovereign credit spreads have remained stable after declining
through much of 2009.

For emerging economies, surging capital inflows are complicating the policy
response to rapid recoveries. Inflows have risen sharply in recent quarters. This can be

explained by a combination of factors, including rapidly improving growth prospects, a rise
in risk appetite, and large interest-rate differentials. Capital inflows are complicating
monetary policy responses in many of these economies, notably where there may be a need
to tighten policy owing to a pick-up in inflation or to slow excessive credit growth (e.g.,
Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia). Although the surge in capital flows to emerging
markets is in its early stages, it is already heightening concerns about the potential for
nominal exchange rate overshooting. Where exchange rate intervention policies are leading
to rapid reserve accumulation, inflows are contributing to inflation, rising pressures on asset
prices, and domestic credit booms.

The multispeed nature of the recovery, renewed risk appetite and, rebounding
capital flows to emerging economies have led to important exchange rate changes. With
improving financial conditions and receding systemic fears, the U.S. dollar has depreciated
in real effective terms since early 2009, as flight-to-safety flows have unwound, and
exchange rates for commodity exporters and

Advanced economy inflation remains subdued and expectations well anchored,
but upward pressures have come to the fore in some emerging economies.
•

In advanced economies, following several month of negative CPI rates, driven largely
by energy prices, twelve-month headline inflation turned positive towards end-2009
in the United States and the euro area, reaching 2.7 percent and 0.9 percent,
respectively, in December. Consumer prices in Japan continued to decline, but at a
slower pace. Advanced economy core inflation has hovered around 1 percent since
mid-2009 and inflation expectations remained anchored around central banks’
inflation objectives.

•

Inflation in emerging economies has picked up and risks of further upward pressures
have risen in some countries. Inflation developments have diverged widely across
countries, with rapidly closing output gaps and agricultural supply shocks in some
economies leading to a marked rebound, or relatively high inflation (e.g., India),
while wider output gaps and nominal exchange rate appreciation in other economies
have limited upward pressures (e.g., South Africa).

Unemployment has stabilized in the major advanced economies and begun to
decline across many emerging economies. Recent labor market developments have varied
across countries, in particular:
•

Among major advanced economies, increases in unemployment rates have varied,
being particularly large in the United States and Spain but relatively subdued in
Germany and the United Kingdom. Recent data in the United States suggest that the
labor market may have stabilized. In other advanced economies, notably across the
euro area, there has been significant labor hoarding and labor productivity has fallen
markedly. This may entail that unemployment increases well into 2010.

•

Some advanced economies (e.g., Australia and Korea) and emerging economies
experienced a smaller increase in unemployment through the crisis. Labor markets in
these economies are now improving, reflecting their more rapid pace of recovery.

•

High unemployment or underemployment poses a problem in many emerging
economies—available statistics point to major increases in emerging Europe
(particularly the Baltic States) and the CIS. Unemployment also remains at very high
levels in some economies, including South Africa.

II. PROSPECTS
9.
The speed of recovery is expected to vary considerably across G-20 countries,
with weaker and more fragile growth in advanced economies contrasting with robust
expansions in most emerging economies, particularly in Asia. After contracting by
0.8 ercent in 2009, global output is expected to expand by around 4 percent in 2010 and
4.3 percent in 2011 on an annual average basis, an upward revision of ¾ and 0.1 percentage
points, respectively, relative to the October World Economic Outlook (Table 1).
•

In the advanced economies, output is expected to expand by 2.1 percent in 2010 and
by 2½ percent in 2011, which makes for a sluggish recovery by historical standards,
with real output remaining below its pre-crisis level until late 2011. Underlying
fragilities, including high unemployment rates and public debt and, in some cases,
weak household balance sheets are expected to remain a drag on private demand.
Credit will be held back by the need to repair bank balance sheets. This will impact
more on those regions where the financial system is largely bank-based and impede
access to credit for SMEs—which have less access to capital markets—and
consumers.

•

In the emerging and developing economies, recovery will be generally more robust
than in advanced economies, but uneven. The recovery in these economies is led by
the strong rebound in emerging Asia and to a lesser extent Latin America—notably
China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil—fueled by strong domestic demand, intraregional trade, and stimulus measures. The rebound of commodity prices will also
help support growth in commodity exporters, including Russia and South Africa.
Other emerging economies are staging modest recoveries, supported by policy
stimulus, increased momentum in trade, and improvements in financial conditions.
Overall, growth in emerging economies in 2010 is projected at about 6 percent.

•

G-20 economies as a group are expected to grow by about 4¼ percent in 2010,
reflecting an upward revision of about 1 percentage points compared with the October
WEO, and by around 4½ percent in 2011.

Projections for public finances diverge significantly, with deteriorations
continuing in advanced economies and more favorable prospects for emerging
economies.
•

For advanced G-20 economies, large fiscal deficits, reflecting cyclical factors,
financial support measures, stimulus packages, and underlying structural spending
pressures are expected to raise the general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio to
about 120 percent in 2014, from around 80 percent in 2008.

•

The sovereign debt outlook is generally more favorable for emerging economies, with
debt ratios expected to decline moderately after 2010 and to remain, on average,
below 40 percent of GDP in the medium term. This results from smaller output losses
in the major emerging markets and lower primary deficits in the midst of the crisis, as
well as the stronger rebound in growth accompanied by some discretionary tightening

to be implemented in 2010. Nevertheless, there are risks to public finances and debt
management for emerging economies with weaker fundamentals, particularly from
possible international spillovers. Specifically, large and rising issuance of sovereign
debt in the advanced economies could lead to higher borrowing costs.

11.
Inflation is expected to remain contained in most advanced economies due to
increasing unemployment and large output gaps, but some emerging economies will
face ongoing upward inflationary pressures.
•

Capacity utilization in advanced economies will remain low, given the projected
sluggish recovery. Also, output gaps will remain wide through 2010, even after
accounting for the decline of potential output due to the financial crisis. Accordingly,
inflationary pressures will remain subdued, despite the projected increase of
commodity prices. In 2010, headline inflation in advanced economies is forecast to
increase to 1¼ percent in 2010 (from zero in 2009), as slowing labor costs are more
than offset by rebounding commodity prices,

•

Inflation in emerging economies is expected to remain slightly over 5 percent.
However, some emerging economies may face stronger upward price pressures due to
more rapidly closing output gaps and increased capital inflows, which in some cases
are leading to rapid reserve accumulation.

III. KEY RISKS
12.
Risks to the outlook are on balance moderately to the downside. In particular,
downside risks include:
•

Sovereign vulnerabilities in the EU periphery, which could lead to rising risk premia
across sovereign bond markets and a higher cost of borrowing for households and
companies;

•

Premature and incoherent exit from supportive policies, which could undermine
confidence in the outlook and undercut the recovery before private domestic demand
becomes self-sustaining;

•

Slow progress in bank resolution, restructuring and recapitalization, which would
unduly restrain the financial sector’s ability to support the recovery by providing
credit and leave the global economy and financial system vulnerable to further
shocks;

•

Slow progress in the reform of regulatory and supervisory arrangements, which
would give rise to additional uncertainty about the future business models and
prospects for the stability of the financial sector;

•

Impaired financial systems and housing markets and/or rising unemployment holding
back the recovery in household spending more than expected in key advanced
economies; and

•

Rallying commodity prices which could constrain the recovery in advanced
economies.

13.
Upside risks include: a quick resolution of fiscal sustainability concerns in some
smaller advanced economies or greater clarity on the new financial regulatory framework,
which could bolster financial market sentiment, bring about a further surge in capital flows
to emerging markets, boost trade, and increase private demand; and new policy initiatives in
the United States to reduce unemployment, which could provide a further impetus to U.S.
and global growth.

IV. POLICY CHALLENGES
A multispeed recovery means that policy challenges vary across countries. With the recovery
in most advanced economies expected to be weak, policy stimulus will need to be maintained
at least through 2010 and possibly augmented in some cases. However, macroeconomic
support cannot substitute for restructuring in securing durable growth; in particular,
financial system reform needs to proceed with a greater sense of urgency. At the same time,
however, policymakers need credible and coherent exit strategies to bridge from
extraordinary short-term support towards the medium-term objective of strong, sustained,
and balanced growth. This should include credible plans to put public finances on a
sustainable path. Some major emerging economies may have to unwind stimulus faster due to
more rapid recoveries and deal with robust capital inflows.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
14.
In the major advanced G-20 economies there will be a need for continued policy
stimulus until private demand gathers sustainable momentum, as the recovery will
remain sluggish and fragile, notwithstanding the recent uptick in growth prospects. Central
banks should maintain low interest rates for some time, given that underlying inflation is
expected to remain subdued and unemployment high through 2010. Fiscal policies need to
remain supportive of economic activity in the near term, and the fiscal stimulus planned for
2010 should be implemented fully. The fiscal impulse should start to be withdrawn in 2011,
except in those economies where markets are rapidly losing confidence in fiscal
sustainability and where tightening should start earlier. In the context of high
unemployment, there may be merit in considering new policy initiatives aimed at boosting
job creation in some countries. However, such measures should be cast within a framework
that ensures sound medium-term fiscal balances.
15.
In some advanced and major emerging economies in the G-20, policy stimulus
will likely need to be unwound sooner than in major advanced economies and
unwinding is already underway in some. Output gaps are rapidly closing in a few
countries (e.g., Korea, emerging Asia, and Brazil) and this has already led to policy
tightening in some cases (e.g., Australia). There are also nascent signs of asset price booms
in a limited set of countries and, in some cases, increasing potential for deteriorating credit
quality (e.g., China).
16.
Policymakers in all countries should remain proactive in preparing their exits
from extraordinary stimulus, recognizing the challenge of mapping a course between
exiting too early and too late. Unwinding stimulus too early could jeopardize progress in
securing economic recovery, and the balance of risks is still in favor maintaining stimulus
for the coming quarters. In addition, it may be prudent to allow some extraordinary financial
sector policy measures, even as they cease to be used, to remain dormant on the books and
thus available for rapid deployment should conditions deteriorate again. However, delaying
exit too long could distort private incentives and pose risks to price, financial, and fiscal

stability. Overall, the multispeed recovery means that the timing of exits will vary across
countries. Most emerging G-20 economies must respond to a faster paced recovery, which
will require exits sooner than in the major advanced economies.
17.
Exiting from crisis-related public support policies should be viewed in the
context of bridging towards strong, sustained and balanced growth with price stability.
Attaining this objective will require meeting the onerous challenges to fiscal sustainability,
normalizing monetary policy carefully withdrawing financial sector support, and avoiding
policy inconsistencies across countries, as well as in the policy mix. To facilitate rebalanced
global growth: advanced economies with large current account deficits should transition
towards measures to raise savings; advanced economies with large surpluses should
prioritize structural reforms in labor and product markets that would bolster domestic
demand; and exits in emerging economies with excessive current account surpluses should
be accompanied by exchange rate appreciation. Fiscal consolidation in major advanced
economies will also mean that emerging economies will have to rely less on external
sources of demand to support growth.
Advanced economies
18.
In most advanced G-20 economies, ensuring fiscal sustainability is a key
priority and policy challenge, notably in light of the surge in government debt levels.
Maintaining an expansionary fiscal stance has a clear and direct impact on the build-up of
debt. Maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance, which can be reversed
quickly, has few obvious direct downsides; the most important risk from this policy stance
in the current low inflationary environment is the potential for liquidity spillovers,
particularly to domestic asset markets and emerging economies. Also, a tightening of the
fiscal stance may help monetary and debt management, while a monetary tightening will
contribute to a worsening of the fiscal position. Hence, on balance fiscal consolidation
should generally take priority, all else given. Achieving fiscal sustainability will be a
difficult and prolonged process, making it imperative for consolidation to begin as soon as
there is clear evidence of self-sustaining recovery. Given a path for fiscal policies, monetary
policy can be set to achieve a desired level of overall stimulus, tightening as needed to
counter inflationary risks and maintain price stability.
19.
While provision of fiscal support will need to be maintained until the recovery
gains a solid footing, advanced G-20 governments should lay out credible mediumterm plans to reduce public debt ratios. Moreover, they should start implementing
immediately elements of these medium-term plans that do not impact negatively on demand.
This includes strengthening fiscal institutions to increase the likelihood that fiscal
adjustment will take place, and undertaking those reforms of entitlement spending that do
not depress consumption—such as increases in the retirement age—or that can be phased in
gradually. A failure to implement these measures would threaten fiscal sustainability and

reduce growth prospects. To achieve fiscal sustainability, authorities need a credible
medium-term fiscal policy strategy that would entail:
•

Clear timeframes to bring the gross debt to GDP ratio to sustainable levels that take
into account longer-term spending pressures. Stabilizing debt ratios at their likely
post-crisis levels will not be sufficient, as high debt ratios would impede fiscal
flexibility, raise economy-wide interest rates, and constrain growth. The appropriate
debt target will depend on economy-specific characteristics, including debt
composition, depth of domestic financial markets, vulnerability to shocks, and
diversification of the investor base.

•

Sustained adjustment in primary structural balances. Experience in past large
consolidations indicates that this is the key element in a successful reduction of the
debt ratio. In advanced economies, the primary balance adjustment required over the
next ten years to return debt ratios to about 60 percent of GDP (80 percent of GDP in
Japan) by 2030 is of the order of 8 percentage points of GDP (from a deficit of
3½ percent of GDP in 2010 to a surplus of 4½ percent of GDP in 2020 and keeping it
at that level for the following decade). Winding down fiscal stimulus measures could
provide only about 1½ percent of GDP—thus additional fiscal measures will be
needed (e.g., reform of pension and healthcare entitlements).

•

Strong fiscal policy frameworks and institutions with comprehensive coverage of the
public sector. Formally adopting or strengthening fiscal rules with explicit fiscal
targets and monitoring by independent fiscal agencies could help shore up the
necessary broad consensus, anchoring expectations and guiding fiscal policy
implementation over the medium term.

20.
Monetary policy can remain accommodative in the major advanced countries,
but central banks need to prepare and clearly communicate credible strategies for
unwinding the extraordinary monetary policy support. The crisis compelled central
banks to employ a wide range of crisis-intervention measures, in many cases unprecedented.
Unwinding should be tractable and central banks have the tools needed to tighten policy, but
there will be challenges.
•

The key objective will be to maintain price stability, but where financial stability
remains fragile, or key markets are not yet functioning, central banks may need to
maintain crisis-intervention measures or possibly introduce new targeted ones, even
within the context of an overall tightening of the monetary policy stance.

•

Central banks will need to unwind conventional and unconventional measures at
different paces. Some unconventional (or “balance sheet”) measures are already being
unwound, as funding markets improve and certain facilities expire or run off
automatically. Central banks can further tighten the parameters of existing facilities,

or introduce new liquidity-absorbing instruments, if tightening is needed before their
balance sheet has been restored to normal levels. However, reducing central banks’
exposure to assets associated with credit easing operations and private or quasisovereign financial instruments will depend on the state of financial markets and may
take considerable time.
Emerging economies
21.
In major emerging (and some advanced) economies experiencing faster
recoveries, including those with sufficient fiscal space, the desirable policy mix may be
different.
•

In a number of emerging economies, monetary policy may have to be tightened
relatively soon (or further where tightening has begun) and ahead of fiscal
consolidation, owing to rising inflation or incipient financial vulnerabilities. In
economies with broadly balanced external positions, monetary tightening may be
complicated, as it could amplify exchange rate pressures. These economies may have
to consider tightening their fiscal stance more quickly (while maintaining measures
aimed at mitigating the social impact of the crisis). Fiscal tightening should also be
the priority where stimulus measures have contributed directly to a strong rebound in
domestic demand, or where market concerns regarding public debt sustainability are
high or rising. Under some circumstances, reserve accumulation, restrictions on
capital inflows and macro-prudential measures could also form part of the policy mix
(see discussion below).

•

Emerging economies that have largely relied on export-led growth, which has led to
large current account surpluses, face a key challenge in the current environment.
Specifically, they need to rebalance their economies away from growth led by
external demand to growth that is increasingly underpinned by robust domestic
demand. Measures to address these challenges could include additional reforms to
reduce precautionary savings, through further efforts to strengthen social safety nets,
reforms of their pension and healthcare systems, and improved corporate governance.

22.
Some emerging market countries will also have to design policies to manage a
surge of capital inflows. Inflows can provide many benefits to the recipient economy. At
times, however, they can also be very large, partly transitory, and inflict lasting damage if
not managed carefully. Addressing the challenges posed by inflows is a complex task. The
right responses differ across countries, including some fiscal tightening to ease pressure on
interest rates and exchange rate appreciation or greater flexibility. Macro-prudential
policies, some reserves accumulation, and carefully designed capital controls on inflows can
also be part of the appropriate response in certain circumstances.

23.
Greater exchange rate flexibility would help reduce capital inflows and
facilitate rebalancing in major emerging surplus economies. Exchange rate appreciation
would help remove one-way bets and reduce capital inflows. At the same time, allowing
currencies to strengthen on a multilateral basis in response to capital inflows would also
help rebalance their sources of growth. Stronger currencies will raise purchasing power and
expand the opportunity set for domestic consumers in these countries and encourage the
needed shift in productive resources from export sectors to domestic services sectors. 2 As
the counterpart, depreciating currencies in major deficit countries would facilitate a needed
adjustment away from overstretched domestic demand. Strengthening multilateral liquidity
provisions and insurance mechanisms through IFIs, could promote greater exchange rate
flexibility, by limiting incentives for excessive reserve accumulation.

Nominal Effective Exchange Rate

reserves, but this is not a long-term solution.

emerging economies.
25.
Monetary and fiscal policies can help to reduce inflows if the central bank has
exhausted the sterilization possibilities and risks losing monetary control, or does not want
to accumulate further reserves (assuming that further exchange rate appreciation would not
be appropriate). The policy response would be to lower interest rates, thus reducing
incentives for inflows, and to tighten fiscal policy–particularly when capital inflows are
driven by fiscal expansion–thus reducing currency appreciation pressures. However, if the
economy is at risk of overheating and there are inflationary pressures, reducing interest rates
is not an attractive policy option, while both political considerations and implementation
lags may limit the scope for fiscal consolidation.

2

For non-renewable resource economies, there are limits to domestic absorption as a mechanism for reducing
surpluses, and, in some cases, few linkages between the production structure involving the natural resource and
nontradable sectors.

26.
Domestic prudential regulation can help limit the risks from inflows, while
capital controls can slow inflows down. 3
•

Macro-prudential policies may offer a broader and longer term solution but do not
represent a panacea. Such policies can be used to address the potential for bubbles at
an early stage by limiting a buildup in risks. Limits on leverage, loan-to-value ratios,
and well-managed margining and collateral systems in securities markets may
usefully form part of this approach. However, deploying such policies requires
changes in the prudential infrastructure that may take time to implement

•

Capital controls may be particularly useful if the inflow surge is short-term in nature.
However, they need to be designed bearing in mind their costs and limitations, and
need to take account of implementation capacity, including: (i) the possible erosion in
their effectiveness over time in today’s deep and sophisticated financial markets;
(ii) the implementation costs, such as those for an enhanced system of unremunerated
reserves; and (iii) the creation of distortions in the domestic financial system.

•

Consideration should also be given to the multilateral repercussions of capital
controls. Their widespread use could have deleterious effects on the efficient
allocation of investment across countries, and for systemic countries, could also
impede necessary steps to address global imbalances by allowing countries to avoid
appreciation where currencies are undervalued, and where appreciation is needed to
support global demand rebalancing. Their adoption may also divert rather than
prevent flows, complicating the management of inflows for other countries, and
triggering contagion in the use of capital controls.
B. Financial Sector Policies

27.
The nature of the policy challenge in advanced G-20 economies is shifting
towards an unwinding of extraordinary support measures and laying the foundation
for a more robust and efficient financial system. The concerted policy response to the
crisis is ebbing gradually as confidence in financial markets gradually returns amid firming
signs of economic revival.
28.
Major work still remains to repair the damage and reduce the distortions,
wrought by the crisis on the financial system. In particular:
•

3

Bank recapitalization. Larger capital buffers are required to absorb the ongoing and
expected future deterioration in credit quality and to meet higher capital standards

Qureshi, and Reinhardt (SPN/10/04; February 19, 2010) discusses these issues in more detail.

expected in the future. This would also reduce the immediate pressures on banks to
deleverage their balance sheets and would provide a solid base from which banks can
provide the necessary credit to a recovering global economy. To facilitate a smooth
adjustment to the new regime, higher capital requirements should be pre-announced
and phased-in gradually.
•

Bank consolidation, resolution, and restructuring. This will facilitate the return to
health of the banking system and help avoid further turbulence from weaker
institutions as extraordinary policy support is withdrawn. In the longer term, care
must be taken that consolidation does not exacerbate the problem of institutions
which are too big to fail. Urgent priorities include: (i) the development of concrete
plans to address funding challenges, given the wall of debt rollovers and likely
withdrawal of liquidity support measures from central banks; and (ii) a reduction in
their reliance on wholesale funding markets. Other key priorities are the development
of special resolution schemes (with a cross-border dimension) for systemically
important institutions and, more generally, steps to address the risks posed by
institutions which are too large and systematically interlinked.

•

Greater urgency and clarity in defining the regulatory framework for a new and safer
financial system. Credible plans and timetables for implementing regulatory reforms
need to be developed and announced, to reduce regulatory uncertainty and to provide
for phased implementation as conditions improve. The timing of implementation
should be carefully chosen, in order to avoid pro-cyclical effects on a still fragile
banking system.

•

Reviving securitization markets, which remain impaired and dependent on official
support. To promote sound securitization, measures could be taken to improve
monitoring along the securitization chain, including by improving disclosure
standards, simplifying and standardizing securitization structures, and restoring the
integrity of the ratings process.

29.
Recent proposals of some G-20 countries may help to reduce systemic risks,
provided they are part of broader, coordinated regulatory reforms. The US
administration, for example, has proposed simple and relatively transparent constraints on
commercial bank activities and size which may serve as a useful back-up to risk-focused
measures (such as capital ratios). It has also joined other G-20 countries in proposing
measures to cover bailout costs and discourage leverage and excessive reliance on wholesale
funding. Such proposals need to be viewed in the context of broader financial sector
reforms, including an assessment of the trade-offs between greater regulation and financial
sector taxation. In particular, proposals for a broad-based financial sector transactions tax
should aim to charge for the commitment of possible sector support and align incentives so
as to reduce systemic risks. Greater attention also needs to be paid to cross-border

supervisory coordination, to ensure a level-playing field for internationally active
institutions.
30.
The timing of exits from financial support policies should remain conditional on
the strength and stability of the underlying activity. In particular:
•

Exiting from some programs could be relatively fast and easy, especially those that
support shorter-term funding markets and liquidity provision—some are falling into
disuse as private market activity revives.

•

Other programs may need to remain in place for some time due to persistent
vulnerabilities, including: enhanced credit support programs through purchases of
private sector securities; and securitization markets, such as for mortgage-backed
paper. Policymakers should err on the side of caution in these areas as market pricing
may give misleading signals on the timing of exit.

•

Some operational changes implemented during the crisis may warrant retention even
as their usage ends in order to guard against unexpected developments, including:
measures to reduce market stigma, such as non-disclosure of standing facility use
during times of stress; broader eligibility of high-quality collateral for central bank
liquidity provision; and a larger number of open market operation counterparties, with
due consideration of administrative costs, to increase the efficiency of money market
transactions.

•

Exits will also need to be made consistent across countries to avoid adverse
spillovers, but this does not necessarily imply that they should be synchronized.

31.
Designing and implementing financial sector reform will require a high degree
of domestic and cross-border coordination. Regulators and fiscal authorities will have to
make sure that policies in their respective areas are not working at cross-purposes or
collectively leading to unduly burdensome outcomes. For instance, financial sector taxation,
if implemented, will need to be coordinated with the prudential regime for financial
institutions. Regulatory regimes will also need to be consistent across countries in order to
reduce the scope for the inefficiencies that arise from regulatory arbitrage.
32.
The exit from the extraordinary support measures implemented in the crisis
must lead to a financial system that is safer as well as sufficiently innovative to support
strong, sustained, and balanced growth. It is encouraging that plans are being developed
to reform the financial system, but momentum must not be lost as market confidence
rebounds. Measures are needed in several areas to resolve the shortcomings that led to a
build-up of systemic risk. In particular:

•

Regulatory gaps should be closed to prevent the transfer of risk to financial
institutions that face different regulatory requirements by broadening the perimeter of
regulation to cover all systemically-important institutions;

•

Risk coverage should be enhanced to more adequately capture certain activities, such
as those that lead to complex derivative, securitization, and repo exposures;

•

Financial sector supervision should be enhanced and will need to be alert to new
market practices, instruments and institutions, including those that develop in
response to a new regulatory environment;

•

Risk management needs to be improved. Regulation and oversight should encourage
private financial institutions to work towards ensuring that risk management practices
are robust and that the drive to increase market share is not undertaken at the expense
of prudent risk management.

•

The quality and transparency of banks’ capital and liquidity should be raised to
provide greater buffers against losses and absorb shocks, to include greater crossborder consistency;

•

Prudential frameworks must play a greater stabilizing role over the business cycle to
avoid the build-up of financial vulnerabilities during the boom phase and the fire
sales and abrupt deleveraging that amplified the impact of the crisis;

•

Measures must reduce financial institutions incentives to become too big to fail or too
interconnected, including by charging for contributions to systemic risk through
higher capital requirements and by encouraging the shifting of bilateral derivative
exposures to strong central counterparties; and

•

Compensation policies must provide effective alignment with prudent risk-taking and
adequate oversight by regulators.

33.
Most emerging economies face fewer challenges in exiting from crisis
interventions but they too must aim to strengthen their financial stability frameworks.
Emerging economy central banks implemented a more limited set of crisis measures focused
on foreign exchange and domestic liquidity provision without reducing policy rates to the
zero bound and sharply expanding balance sheets. A large portion of crisis intervention
measures in these economies has already been unwound. The challenge now for them is to
continue strengthening their financial stability frameworks to ensure that capital inflows are
put to good use, with a view to avoiding the excesses manifested elsewhere in the run-up to
this crisis.
