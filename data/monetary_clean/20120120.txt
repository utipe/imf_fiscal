The three requirements for a more resilient recovery are sustained but gradual adjustment. ample liquidity and easy monetary policy, mainly in advanced economies. and more confidence in policymakers’ ability to act decisively. Importantly, not all countries should adjust in the same way, to the same extent, or at the same time, lest their efforts become self-defeating. Countries with relatively strong fiscal and external positions, for example, should not adjust to the same extent as countries facing market pressures. A successful resolution of the current crisis will thus require a cohesive, comprehensive, and cooperative package of policies across the G-20. Easier monetary policy. The adverse feedback loops between low growth, deteriorating public finances, and banking sector stress could lead to a prolong period of asset and consumer price deflation. To forestall this adverse circuit, the ECB’s monetary policy should be highly accommodative, consistent with its mandate of ensuring price stability. This could be achieved by lower ECB monetary policy interest rates, for which room exists, and, as needed, further unconventional measures. Monetary policies in other G-20 advanced economies should remain highly accommodative. The Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan should stand ready to continue or expand their deployment of unconventional measures, if needed. In particular, to ensure that the transmission mechanism for monetary policy remains effective, efforts should be directed at devising targeted schemes that help ease credit constraints on firms and households. Monetary policies can be eased in economies with diminishing inflationary pressure but weaker fiscal fundamentals (for example, various economies in Latin America). But this must be accompanied by macro- prudential measures and enhanced financial supervision where there are risks of overheating in some sectors (such as real estate).
