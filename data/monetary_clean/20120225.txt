The three requirements for a more resilient recovery are: sustained but gradual fiscal adjustment. ample liquidity and easy monetary policy, particularly in advanced economies. and greater confidence in policymakers’ ability to act decisively. Importantly, the type, scale, and timing of adjustment should not be the same, but depend on each country’s own circumstances, or efforts may become self-defeating. Reestablishing confidence and resolving the current crisis requires a cohesive, comprehensive, and cooperative package of policies across the G-20. Liquidity and Monetary Policy. Monetary policy should continue to support growth, as inflation expectations remain anchored and unemployment is high. If downside risks materialize, the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan should stand ready to expand unconventional support. Targeted programs to ease credit constraints would be also useful where the transmission mechanism is impaired. The ECB’s monetary policy should be highly accommodative, consistent with its mandate of ensuring price stability. This could be achieved by lowering the target policy rate, for which room exists, and, as needed, further unconventional measures. Also, the ECB should continue to provide liquidity and stay fully engaged in securities purchases to help improve the prospects for financial stability. Where inflationary pressures are diminishing and fiscal fundamentals are weak, monetary policy can be eased. But this must be accompanied by macro- prudential and enhanced financial supervision where there are risks of overheating in some sectors (such as real estate).
