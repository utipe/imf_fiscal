Tighten monetary policy and, notably in key surplus economies, allow for greater exchange rate flexibility. Notwithstanding recent rate hikes in some emerging economies, real interest rates remain far below precrisis levels and hence too low. Greater exchange rate appreciation would dampen inflationary pressures, including from world commodity prices, introduce more two-way risk for capital inflows, and facilitate external rebalancing in surplus economies. Accelerate fiscal consolidation. Current projections are for a limited decline in budget deficits of emerging economies in 2011 and 2012, even though output growth and capacity utilization would continue to be above pre-crisis trend. In external deficit economies, fiscal tightening would take some of the adjustment burden from monetary policy and the exchange rate, and allow for lower interest rates, all else equal, which could rebuild policy space, restrain widening current account deficits, and reduce net capital inflow pressures. Manage capital flows by fully utilizing macroeconomic and prudential tools, tailored to country-specific circumstances. If inflows raise macro- and financial-stability concerns, macroeconomic policies (for example, adjusting the fiscal-monetary policy mix, exchange rate appreciation, and some reserve accumulation) should be complemented with strengthened prudential measures (for example, loan to value ratios, funding composition restrictions). Capital controls can be used in some cases, but they should not substitute for necessary macroeconomic and prudential policies. In emerging economies, monetary policy may need to respond more sensitively to first-round inflation shocks from higher commodity prices due to higher pass-through (mainly for food prices, less so for energy), less well-anchored inflation expectations, and economies that are operating closer to, or above, capacity.
