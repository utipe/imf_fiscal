"With multiple interdependent factors holding back growth, policymakers have to work all necessary levers— structural policies (including to promote financial stability and trade), fiscal policies, and monetary policy",0,0
"Depending on country needs, comprehensive action will combine structural reforms with demand support, anchored by coherent and well-communicated policy frameworks",0,0
"Efforts to advance global trade integration, lower financial stability risks, and address geopolitical spillovers remain vital",0,0
"Taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment and depending on the availability of fiscal space, there is a case for more public investment",1,1
"Where interest rates are at or near their effective lower bounds, fiscal policy must play a larger role",0,1
Other helpful measures include adjusting the composition of spending toward public investment and moving the revenue structure toward indirect and other taxes relatively less detrimental to growth,0,0
Sustainably higher and inclusive growth requires more forceful and comprehensive policies,0,0
"In a number of countries, it may be appropriate to devote fiscal resources to reduce private sector debt overhangs and repair financial sector balance sheets.",-1,1
"Where monetary policy operates near or at the lower bound, growth-friendly fiscal policy has an important role to play",1,1
But medium-term risks to the sustainability remain unaddressed,0,0
"Overdoing fiscal adjustment in the short run to counter cyclical revenue losses will undercut activity further, diminish popular support for adjustment, and further undermine market confidence",0,0
"In the United States and Japan, policymakers should redouble efforts to formulate and implement credible medium-term consolidation plans",-1,-1
"Countries with policy space might consider slowing structural fiscal adjustment in 2012, while maintaining their commitment to a credible medium-term consolidation plan",1,0
"In other G-20 advanced economies, there remains an urgent priority to set out a credible path for fiscal consolidation over the medium-term",-1,-1
"Measures could include entitlement reforms including new health care and pension saving measures, caps on discretionary spending, and tax system reforms to boost fiscal revenue",-1,-1
those facing very low funding costs should consider a slower pace of consolidation,1,0
"Putting in place such plans will also reinforce policy room to support balance sheet repair, growth, and job creation during this period of heightened vulnerability",0,0
"Countries should allow automatic stabilizers operate freely, provided they can secure funding for higher deficits",1,0
"In the near term, sufficient fiscal adjustment is planned in most advanced economies",0,0
"In the United States, there is a risk that political paralysis could lead to an excessively rapid pace of deficit reduction, including an early expiry of the existing stimulus measures such as the payroll tax cut",0,0
Such developments would further undermine the already weak recovery.,0,0
"Fiscal consolidation must continue in many euro area economies, but it should be structured and paced to avoid a collapse in demand and growth",-1,0
Sufficient near-term fiscal adjustment is in train in most economies,0,0
"in those economies that can afford to do so, the pace of near-term fiscal consolidation should slow",1,0
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully,1,0
"Also, rebalancing of global demand was viewed as not being strong enough to sustain high global growth and achieve low unemployment",0,0
"In particular, fiscal consolidation was assessed to be insufficient to decisively address sustainability issues in a number of advanced economies",0,0
The design of fiscal consolidation plans should be “growth friendly” to the extent possible in terms of its composition,1,0
"To lessen the contractionary effect of the deficit reduction, part of it is financed through a growthsupporting shift in the composition of taxation from income to consumption",0,0
"Reducing public debt to more prudent (for example, pre-crisis) levels over the medium term is desirable for several reasons, including: (i) a need to rebuild fiscal space to deal with future shocks; (ii) possibly higher interest rates and lower potential growth given high public debt; and (iii) the need to prepare for formidable longer-term challenges on public finances— notably, rising health care costs and aging",-1,-1
"This would seem to require a sufficient scale of adjustment, more efficient redistribution of the tax burden and allocation of spending, as well as clear and effective communication of credible and coherent fiscal consolidation strategies",-1,0
The upside scenario explores the role of three core elements of the fiscal consolidation package,0,0
This could reinforce market concerns about debt sustainability,0,0
"Finally, fiscal actions that lower payroll taxes or other non-wage costs (for example, social security contributions) could also strengthen the employment effect in the upside",0,0
"Thus, elements of alternative policy scenarios should consider fiscal consolidation, notably in economies with large fiscal and external deficits",-1,0
"Current account deficits would narrow in advanced deficit countries, matched by lower external surpluses in emerging and advanced surplus countries",0,0
"For the purpose of the upside scenario, based on Fund staff assessment of fiscal consolidation needs in each country or region, the (stylized) fiscal package is constructed as follows: For the United States",0,0
"On the back of lower potential, public finances would worsen given lower tax revenues and automatic stabilizers, pushing up interest rates with likely adverse feedback effects on growth and confidence",0,0
Fiscal consolidation in the event of deteriorating market sentiment and lower potential output would need to be stronger and more front-loaded to try to reassure markets,-1,-1
"As credibility of fiscal policy increases over time, private spending is increasingly “crowded in.” Investment and employment increase and economic activity gains momentum, resulting in higher real GDP relative to the baseline over the medium term",0,0
"Within this realm, there are many possible options and an indicative set of policies considered here is as follows",0,0
Minimizing tax distortion is a key principle for the design,0,0
This reflects insufficient rebalancing of global demand,0,0
"However, the policy measures boost growth significantly over the medium term for two reasons",0,0
"FISCAL CONSOLIDATION TO RESTORE SUSTAINABILITY IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES In the upside scenario, fiscal adjustment is underpinned, to the extent possible, by sound and “growth-friendly” policies, underscoring the role of credibility",-1,0
"In this regard, credible and coherent fiscal plans should be clearly communicated as soon as possible",-1,0
"For advanced economies, the simulated fiscal consolidation lowers real GDP relative to the baseline, primarily reflecting lower disposable income and aggregate demand",0,0
"With less-than-full credibility of fiscal plans, private expectations anticipate some reversal or slippage in consolidation",0,0
These policy “layers” can be motivated as follows,0,0
More credible fiscal adjustment would mitigate but would not likely reverse the decline in domestic demand in those economies undergoing consolidation,0,0
The timing and magnitude of consolidation should be tied to country circumstances,0,0
"Major fiscal consolidation is needed in the years ahead in G-20 economies with high public deficits and debt.3 Different economic circumstances and policy needs across advanced economies would determine the timing, magnitude, and composition of consolidation at the individual country level",-1,-1
"Concretely, private expectations in the model align with the authorities’ fiscal consolidation objectives from this point onwards",0,0
"To restore sustainability of public finances, while mitigating the impact on growth, three core elements of fiscal consolidation would be instrumental: (i) sufficient scale to improve primary fiscal balances to stabilize public debt at prudent levels, given growth and interest rates; (ii) growth-friendly composition of fiscal measures to mitigate the dampening effect on demand, including through entitlement reform; and (iii) strengthened credibility of fiscal plans, including through clear and effective communication to market participants, to align market expectations with the authorities’ medium-term consolidation strategy",-1,0
Weaker potential output would have adverse implication for fiscal positions,0,0
"If investors and consumers doubt that the package would be fully implemented, investment and employment responses over the near term would be weaker than otherwise",0,0
The set of policy options that could strengthen G-20 outcomes would require collaborative action across the membership,0,0
"The major policy actions considered across the G-20 include: (i) “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation in advanced economies; (ii) structural reforms (including strengthening social safety nets) and sustained infrastructure spending in emerging surplus economies, accompanied by increased exchange rate flexibility; and (iii) structural reforms in advanced economies to tackle high unemployment and weaker potential output following the crisis",0,0
The scale and composition of the package should take into account country-specific circumstances,0,0
"Driven by strong and credible consolidation, public finances would be returned onto a sustainable trajectory in G-20 advanced economies",0,0
"However, when compared with historical evidence relating to recovery from crises and staff’s analysis in the World Economic Outlook (WEO), growth projections appeared optimistic",0,0
"Second, with the supply of labor and capital relatively elastic over the longer term, while consumption demand is relatively inelastic, a shift of the tax burden towards consumption reduces distortions, and, therefore boosts output.",0,0
Credibility is defined in terms of what the private sector believes about a certain policy action,0,0
Credibility is a critical element for successful fiscal adjustment,0,0
"In particular: (i) sufficient scale; (ii) growthfriendly composition; and, (iii) strengthened credibility of fiscal plans, along the following lines",0,0
"Finally, it was assessed that stronger efforts to repair and reform the financial system was needed to support G-20 growth objectives, while safeguarding financial stability",-1,0
"The euro area current account would be broadly unchanged, but imbalances within the area would narrow",0,0
"Owing to large and credible fiscal consolidation, sovereign risk premia and long-term interest rates decline",0,0
"Consolidation plans should be strong, credible, and, to the extent possible, supportive of growth",-1,-1
"In advanced economies, lower growth than projected in the MAP would result in lower tax revenues, higher-than-projected fiscal deficits, and rising public debt burdens (already at high levels)",0,0
Monetary policy mitigates the slowdown by remaining accommodative longer relative to the baseline,0,0
"However, if economic agents gain confidence in fiscal implementation, expectations would closely align with the goals of a (fully-credible) consolidation strategy",0,0
"In the “base case,” fiscal deficits and debt levels in advanced economies are projected to remain large, notwithstanding favorable macroeconomic outcomes",0,0
"However, if economic agents have full credibility in fiscal plans, then, the growth-enhancing effects (for example, through lower interest rates) of the fiscal package would be realized sooner",0,0
These two elements constitute key elements of the downside scenario,0,0
Stronger fiscal consolidation would allow monetary accommodation to be maintained for a longer time to help support activity,0,0
"To stabilize public debt at prudent levels, the scale of fiscal adjustment would need to be sufficiently strong, accounting for country-specific needs",-1,-1
This could weigh on the recovery and further raise market pressure in an environment of elevated uncertainty about sovereign debt risks,0,0
"Insufficiently credible adjustment plans may result in sharp increases of these risk premia— dampening growth in the affected economies, with an impact on public debt (both directly and indirectly)",0,0
"Where applicable, starting in 2011 additional consolidation is assumed relative to the plans in G-20 policy frameworks; all measures are phased in gradually over 5 years, with policies gaining full credibility by the third year of the consolidation plan (i.e., from 2013 onwards private expectations in the model are aligned with the authorities’ fiscal consolidation objectives in each country)",0,0
"Total fiscal adjustment in the upside (including what is already in the baseline from G-20 policy frameworks) amounts to approximately 9½ and 6 percent of GDP in advanced deficit and advanced surplus economies, respectively",0,0
"Where applicable, additional consolidation starting in 2011 is assumed relative to the plans in G-20 policy frameworks; all measures are phased in gradually over 5 years, with policies gaining full credibility by the third year of the consolidation plan (i.e., in 2013)",0,0
"The shift in tax composition—as part of the consolidation—increases overall tax revenues by ½ percent of GDP and is designed as follows (for the United States block in the model): consumption tax revenues increase by 5 percent of GDP (equivalent to an increase in consumption tax rates of about 8 percentage points), while labor and capital income tax revenues decrease by 4½ percent of GDP (equivalent to a cut of 6 percentage points of the underlying effective tax rates)",0,0
Key aspects of each component are elaborated below,0,0
"Recognizing that the effect of fiscal consolidation will partly depend on the composition of expenditure and tax instruments, the model examines the impact of: (i) lower taxes on capital and labor; (ii) higher taxes on consumption; and (iii) entitlement reform (through lower transfers) and some cuts in government consumption",0,0
"Against the backdrop of recent market developments, higher sovereign interest rate risk premia are a key risk belonging to the downside scenario",0,0
The fiscal deficit is reduced by 3 percentage points of GDP,0,0
"Credible fiscal consolidation over the medium term, underpinned by high-quality measures of sufficient magnitude, should be a top priority in advanced deficit economies given sovereign debt market stress and other fiscal risks",-1,-1
"Compared to the upside scenario, much larger fiscal consolidation would be needed to ensure the sustainability of public finances",0,-1
"For example, a shift from payroll taxes to consumption tax (or VAT depending on country circumstances) facilitates fiscal consolidation by increasing employment and potential output",0,0
"Moreover, even assuming that the “base case” scenario materialized, the analysis identified some key weaknesses",0,0
Clear and effective communication of coherent consolidation plans and strengthening of budgetary institutions and frameworks would help fiscal credibility visà-vis the private sector,-1,-1
"The scenario shows that fiscal consolidation alone—while supportive of growth in the medium term—in advanced G-20 economies would dampen growth in the short run, including for G-20 partner countries (Figure 1)",0,0
"Accordingly, monetary policy in advanced economies could afford to stay accommodative for a more extended period, since inflation pressures remain contained and inflation expectations are well anchored",0,0
Substantial budgetary effort would be required to restore fiscal soundness and to rebuild market confidence,-1,-1
Credibility is defined in terms of what the private sector believes about the fiscal policy action,0,0
Weaker external demand (relative to the baseline) from advanced partners more than offsets the benefits of lower interest rates globally,0,0
Fund staff assessment of macroeconomic and policy frameworks submitted by G-20 members identified several economic and policy issues and key risks,0,0
"This box discusses a stylized package of fiscal policies designed to achieve fiscal consolidation, while supporting growth over the medium term",0,0
"There is a pressing need, in general, for fiscal consolidation in G-20 advanced economies",-1,-1
"Moreover, the credibility of (forced) fiscal adjustment would likely be lower in a downside scenario, likely affecting the impact on private spending",0,0
"For emerging Asia and ROW, however, real GDP remains lower relative to the baseline over the projection horizon, given their high export dependence",0,0
The motivation behind the above fiscal package is to support growth over the medium term,0,1
"Finally, credibility is a critical element for successful fiscal adjustment",0,0
"Under partial credibility, markets anticipate some reversal or slippage in consolidation and thus, investment and employment responses over the near term would be weaker than otherwise",0,0
"Monetary policy accommodation could be maintained for a more extended period to help support activity, since inflation would remain contained as fiscal balances are strengthened",0,0
"Combined with the lower capital income taxes, investment is “crowded in,” and the shift away from labor taxes increases employment, boosting the supply potential significantly",0,
"Accordingly, the assumed fiscal consolidation in the scenario is broadly in line with stabilizing public debt-to-GDP ratios at pre-crisis levels",0,
"First, lower deficits increase saving and thus, reduce real interest rates over time",0,
"While global imbalances would narrow, global growth would be lower",0,
"Moreover, credibility would be lacking if fiscal adjustment were forced by adverse market reaction, reinforcing (rather than mitigating) negative demand effects",0,
"The assessment found that the G-20 “base case” projections, at face value, appear to deliver strong, sustainable and balanced growth",0,
"Other avenues that could be considered (but are outside the model) include eliminating existing tax distortions, including those relating to the treatment of financial leverage or energy consumption",0,
"In the upside scenario, fiscal policies are assumed to steadily gain credibility over time",0,
"Thus, the case for global rebalancing is strong",0,
In the near term growth declines slightly relative to the refined baseline due to negative multiplier effects of lower government spending and an initial lack of credibility,0,
"Specifically, a reduction in labor and capital income taxes by 4.5 percent of GDP (approximately 6 percentage points cuts in the effective tax rates, each) is more than offset by a 5 percent of GDP increase in consumption tax revenue (i.e., an increase of consumption tax rate by 8 percentage points)",0,
"Specifically: A shift from payroll to consumption taxes facilitates fiscal consolidation, while increasing medium-term potential output.5 While tax increases may be unavoidable, this should be done in the least distortionary manner possible",-1,
Credible consolidation plans—designed to be “growth friendly”—would mitigate the dampening effect on domestic demand,-1,
"This contributes to cross-country variation in overall implementation, as the composition of stimulus differs by country",0,
"Comprehensive medium-term macroeconomic strategies should be announced as soon as is feasible, to anchor expectations in credible paths for debt and deficit reduction",-1,
"Implementation of higher multiplier items is likely to pick up in the second half of 2009, particularly in infrastructure, suggesting that growth and employment impacts could increase during the remainder of the year",0,
"Going forward, a strategy to ensure fiscal solvency should be articulated",-1,
"The crisis is, however, having a substantial impact on fiscal positions in G-20 countries, with overall deficits projected to increase by 5.percentage points and 5.percentage points of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively, from pre-crisis levels",0,
"Planned crisis-related discretionary measures are estimated at 2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 1.percent of GDP in 2010.A full progress report on implementation of fiscal stimulus packages in G-20 countries to date is difficult, given operational challenges in reporting and limited specific information.In general, however, implementation rates are reported to be higher for revenue measures and social transfers and lower for infrastructure projects",0,
The stimulus measures implemented most rapidly—tax breaks and transfer payments—typically have lower multipliers,0,
"This should be based on:  a firm commitment and a clear strategy to contain aging-related spending, especially in advanced economies",-1,
"and bolstering confidence in fiscal sustainability, which should help to limit increases in bond yields",0,
Entitlements reforms need to be put in place now to underpin fiscal sustainability.,-1,
"Estimated growth impacts range from 1.to 4.percentage points in 2009 and from zero to 0.percentage points in 2010, both with respect to the previous year",0,
and  fiscal policies cast within medium-term fiscal frameworks (and supportive institutional arrangements) that envisage a gradual fiscal correction once economic conditions improve,1,
"Reforms in the these areas will play a key role by: directly improving prospects for the primary balance, thereby helping to contain the debt-to-GDP ratio",-1,
"During the crisis, countries with existing fiscal rules (for example the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact) have generally retained them—in some cases making use of escape clauses",0,
The crisis has tested their resilience and highlighted the importance of built-in flexibility,0,
growth-enhancing structural reforms,0,
"Considerable fiscal stimulus remains in the pipeline through 2010 for the G-20 as a whole, and should be implemented expeditiously to maximize the impact on growth and employment",1,
"G-20 countries have provided substantial fiscal stimulus, which when fully implemented will have a sizeable impact on growth",0,
"At the Toronto Summit, G-20 Leaders in advanced economies agreed to halve fiscal deficits by 2013 and to stabilize or reduce public debt by 2016",0,
"Overall, G-20 fiscal policies appear broadly on track to meet the Toronto commitments, but medium-term consolidation plans for some countries rely on relatively optimistic growth assumptions and very few countries have thus far articulated credible plans underpinned by specific measures in key areas",0,
"Large oil-exporting economies have also committed to some consolidation, though budgets retain an emphasis on public investment",0,
"Notwithstanding progress, central policy challenges are to formulate clear, credible, and ambitious medium-term plans",-1,
"Stronger governance and budgetary institutions in many cases would strengthen such efforts, which will need to be sustained",0,
"In many countries, fiscal consolidation over the medium-term is to be achieved through entitlement and tax system reforms and “pay-go” principles",-1,
"Consequently, further fiscal consolidation in advanced economies is considered as a “second layer” to help restore soundness of public finances",0,
"Beyond the MAP framework, long-term fiscal plans to restore sustainability of public finances will be required to rebuild policy space and to address long-run budgetary pressures",-1,
Medium-term plans need to be underpinned by specific commitments in critical areas—including entitlement and tax reforms that are supportive of growth,-1,
Fiscal consolidation is an essential part of internal rebalancing,-1,
"Many advanced surplus economies have also announced consolidation plans, but the degree of specificity in identifying measures vary significantly",0,
"In these economies, increased non-oil infrastructure spending is aimed at relieving supply bottlenecks and sustaining growth with less dependence on oil prices",0,
"This would result in higher fiscal deficits than otherwise (i.e., at unchanged policies)",0,
"Responding to severe market pressure earlier this year, notably concerning sovereign risks, some advanced deficit economies have announced or brought forward fiscal consolidation plans.2 Plans differ across countries both in magnitude and pace of adjustment, reflecting the strength of economic recovery, the amount of fiscal space, and the reaction of markets to the strength of public balance sheets",0,
The magnitude of the additional fiscal effort is based on the path of fiscal balances that is consistent with growth in the revised G-20 baseline (see Box IV.2),0,
"In order to halve the 2010 fiscal deficit by 2013, added fiscal effort is required (text table)",0,
Some emerging deficit economies have begun fiscal tightening and announced medium-term consolidation plans,0,
"In many cases, the broad measures are dependent upon the pace and durability of economic recovery, and consolidation plans lack sufficient specificity to anchor credibility",0,
"In many cases, consolidation plans are accompanied by measures to increase transparency of the budget process",0,
"In such cases the combination of temporary macroeconomic support—well-anchored by credible medium-term policy frameworks—with growth-enhancing structural reforms can deliver more than the sum of its parts.In countries where fiscal adjustment is needed, consolidation should be gradual and as growth-friendly as possible, while structural reforms should prioritize lower-cost measures that could have a beneficial impact on public finances over the medium-term.",-1,
Reinforcing the growth momentum requires the right mix of demand support and supply reforms,0,
"In economies operating close to full capacity (such as the United States and Germany), any fiscal support should be oriented toward increasing potential output, for instance through investment in high-quality infrastructure, including social infrastructure such as education, health, or childcare",1,
"In the United States, monetary policy normalization should continue to be gradual and data driven",0,
"Emerging economies face starkly diverse cyclical positions, but the emphasis should generally be on enhancing resilience (as discussed below)",0,
"In Germany, higher public investment would also contribute to reducing the very high current account balance surplus",0,
Exploiting synergies between short-term support and structural reforms is even more crucial where fiscal space is limited and monetary policy operates close to the effective lower bound,0,
"In economies with insufficient demand but available fiscal space, fiscal policy can support short-term growth while also focusing on boosting the supply potential of the economy",1,
"In those advanced economies where inflation remains below target, a supportive monetary policy stance should be maintained, relying on unconventional measures, as needed—for example in the euro area and Japan",0,
"Fiscal consolidation in advanced economies should begin in 2011, but the type and speed of adjustment should reflect different circumstances in different countries, especially in terms of the pace of recovery and risks to fiscal credibility",-1,
"Collaborative policies that support a rebalancing of global demand are crucial to secure strong, sustainable, and balanced growth",0,
"External rebalancing will require reforms aimed at boosting domestic demand in emerging surplus economies, notably through greater exchange rate flexibility",0,
Successful fiscal adjustment will require that medium-term consolidation plans are accompanied by structural reforms that raise the trend level of growth and thus support long-term fiscal solvency,0,
"In advanced economies, two key policy priorities—financial sector reform and credible medium-term fiscal consolidation—are central to catalyzing a pickup in private demand",-1,
"In all but the most vulnerable countries, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully and, where stabilizers are small, temporary support (such as extended unemployment benefits or wage subsidies) could be continued",1,
Fiscal policies must increasingly address medium-term requirements to enable debt sustainability,-1,
"If growth risks to slow appreciably more than expected, some of the planned consolidation could be slowed or postponed in countries with more fiscal room",1,
"On the whole, country consolidation plans for 2011 strike an appropriate balance between making a credible start toward strengthening public finances and continuing to support the recovery",0,
A key priority is for policymakers to further specify and begin implementing medium-term consolidation plans to help achieve sustainable fiscal positions,-1,
"Monetary policy must remain the first line of defense, although this line is becoming increasingly thin in most advanced economies",0,
"Moderate adjustments to current policies, such as increasing the retirement age, may entail no effect on demand in the short-run but can have large beneficial effects on fiscal sustainability",0,
"Medium-term consolidation plans should emphasize policy measures that reform rapidly growing spending programs—such as pensions and public health care—and make permanent reductions to non-entitlement spending, with a view to improving labor supply and investment",-1,
"Credible medium-term consolidation in advanced economies may allow more fiscal room, alleviating the need for accommodative monetary policy and reducing large and potentially unstable flows to emerging economies.",0,
"Strengthening fiscal institutions, through improved budgetary processes, better fiscal monitoring, and, in the EU, improved governance frameworks, can play important roles in consolidation",-1,
"Under current policies, spending on pensions and health care is projected to increase substantially over the next two decades, especially in the advanced economies",0,
"Second, the extent to which the projected debt-to-GDP ratio is viewed as sustainable depends in part on the outlook for pension and health care expenditures over the longer run",0,
Medium-term fiscal frameworks can also play a role in recovering from high debt positions.Explicit medium-term fiscal targets would help provide a clear indication of what country authorities perceive as a desirable fiscal policy path,-1,
"During the crisis, countries with existing fiscal rules have, for the most part, retained them—in some cases making use of escape clauses—although the crisis has tested their resilience and highlighted the importance of built-in flexibility to avoid tightening during recessions",0,
"Going forward, a strategy to ensure fiscal solvency should be based on:  a firm commitment and a clear strategy to contain aging-related spending, especially in advanced economies",-1,
growth-enhancing structural reforms,0,
"Such targets can help anchor market expectations if they are credibly set and buttressed by appropriate institutional frameworks (for example, medium-term expenditure frameworks that set multi-year limits at the aggregate, ministerial, or program level, in order to translate overall objectives into budget decisions)",9,
"Owing to these pressures, which existed prior to the global financial and economic crisis, attaining a given primary surplus presents greater challenges than in the past",9,
"For instance, the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact has been flexible enough to accommodate the currently envisaged fiscal responses to the crisis.22",9,
"First, reforms that reduce the trajectory of aging-related spending can contribute to improving prospects for the primary balance, thereby helping to contain the debt-to-GDP ratio",-1,
and  fiscal policies cast within medium-term fiscal frameworks (and supportive institutional arrangements) that envisage a gradual fiscal correction once economic conditions improve.20 Any successful strategy to ensure that public debt is kept on a sustainable path will need to include measures to contain aging-related spending,-1,
"Thus, reforms that improve the long-run outlook would, other things equal, permit a somewhat less ambitious reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the coming years",0,
Entitlement reforms in the areas of pensions and health care will play a key role in two respects,-1,
"At the same time, progress on other fronts is crucial",0,
"Widespread financial, fiscal, and structural impediments need to be addressed to bolster growth and financial stability",0,
Clear communication of central bank intentions is vital to help avoid new financial excesses or abrupt reversals of capital flows,0,
"More policy ambition and cooperation are needed to achieve the G-20’s shared objectives of strong, sustainable, and balanced growth",0,
"This should be anchored by credible plans for debt reduction—notably, for the United States and Japan",-1,
"For economies not under market pressure, achieving structural fiscal targets and allowing automatic stabilizers to play freely is key",1,
"In particular, implementing a measured pace of fiscal tightening (based on a consolidation mix that is supportive of medium-term growth) including entitlement reform remains central",-1,
"In an environment of ongoing but incomplete transition to financial stability, changing growth dynamics and concerns about slow growth and high unemployment, achieving a better policy mix is important",0,
The problems facing the global economy are complex and joint action can help,0,
"In the euro area, bank balance sheet repair remain essential to restore confidence and revive credit growth, and policymakers should make further progress on banking union through a Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism, and advance structural reforms",0,
"Additional unconventional monetary support (targeted long term refinancing operations, lower collateral haircuts) could also help reduce fragmentation and restore monetary transmission.",0,
"A heavy reliance on unconventional monetary policy (UMP), for example, has had overall positive effects and has bought time but needs support from other policies to succeed",0,
"In advanced economies, while exceptional monetary accommodation, including through UMP, continues to provide important support to the recovery, potential side effects should be monitored closely and addressed as needed",0,
"There is scope for better cooperation on withdrawal of UMP, especially through wider central bank discussions of exit plans",0,
"Reflecting market concerns, vulnerable economies have front-loaded fiscal adjustment",0,
"Short- and medium-term prospects point to a slow, sluggish recovery that is subject to mainly downside risks",0,
"Moderate adjustments, such as increasing the retirement age, may entail no affect on demand in the short-run",0,
"If downside risks to global growth materialize, threatening to slow growth appreciably more than expected, monetary policy should be the first line of defense, although this line has become thin",0,
"Most other advanced G-20 economies should start tightening in 2011, and the average adjustment implicit in current plans appears broadly appropriate.",-1,
"However, fiscal policies need to urgently deliver measures that lower deficits over the medium-term",-1,
Policies need to accelerate the rebalancing of demand from public to private sources in advanced economies and from external deficit to surplus economies,0,
"Additionally, fiscal adjustment needs to be supported with structural reform",0,
"Fiscal consolidation remains essential for strong, sustained growth over the medium run",-1,
"The timing and pace of fiscal consolidation will vary across the G-20, dictated by differing country circumstances",0,
"Policymakers need to specify further measures and begin to deliver on ambitious, credible and “growth-friendly” medium-term consolidation plans, particularly in key advanced economies",-1,
"In these countries, strong signals to see these adjustments through, even if politically difficult, will be critical to prevent adverse market reaction that forces yet additional front-loaded adjustment",0,
Countries that have come under market pressure and those facing the greatest fiscal challenges/lacking fiscal room have already started to consolidate and announced further front-loading (see below),0,
Government budgetary policies are in the process of moving from short-term stimulus to medium-term consolidation,-1,
"Strengthening fiscal institutions, such as by improving budgetary processes, better fiscal monitoring, and, in the EU, improving the governance framework can play important roles in consolidation",0,
"Policies that eliminate distortions to domestic demand in key emerging economies would strengthen prospects for external demand rebalancing, supporting a more robust recovery in both emerging and advanced economies",0,
"In many advanced economies, the financial sector remains the Achilles heel of recovery prospects for private demand",0,
"Additionally, to sustain recovery in these countries some of the consolidation planned for 2011 might also have to be temporarily postponed",1,
"In most G-20 advanced economies, public debt sustainability requires exits from crisis-induced policies as well as broader adjustments to improve net debt levels",-1,
"Plans should emphasize policy measures that reform rapidly growing spending programs—pensions and public health care2—and make permanent reductions to non-entitlement spending, with a view to improving medium-term conditions for labor supply and investment",-1,
Fiscal adjustment needs to begin in 2011,-1,
Accelerated financial sector restructuring and reform should thus be top priorities,-1,
"The timing, pace, and sequence of exiting from supportive policies will vary by country, depending on how robust the recovery of private demand as well as financial conditions",0,
"There is increasing divergence in the monetary policy stances between advanced and emerging economies, reflecting macroeconomic developments, while financial sector support has been extended in some European countries",0,
"Accordingly, in countries with fiscal room, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to play freely, and where stabilizers are small, temporary support, such as extended unemployment benefits or wage subsidies, could be continued",1,
"This is needed not only to halt and ultimately reverse the large rise in public debt ratios, but also to help create room for policy maneuver to support private demand",-1,
"Insufficient progress with repair and reform is weighing on credit, and slowing the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies, with adverse spillovers on emerging economies",0,
"In emerging economies, the challenge will be to improve the coverage of health safety nets while preserving long-term fiscal sustainability, as health indicators are substantially lower than in advanced countries",0,
"Raising revenue by widening tax bases and removing distortions, rather than by raising tax rates, should be part of the adjustment package in some economies",0,
Revenue measures in economies where adjustment needs are large and/ or revenue ratios are low,0,
"Deep entitlement reforms in advanced economies, particularly in health care, where policymakers will have to balance the need to ensure access with the requirement of maintaining sustainability of public finances",0,
Emerging economies should use revenue buoyancy related to high asset and commodity prices and favorable economic conditions to rebuild fiscal buffers rather than increase spending in the near term,0,
"In all advanced economies, additional revenues from faster-than-anticipated growth should be saved",0,
"Substantial fiscal consolidation in many advanced economies is in the pipeline, but clear and credible medium-term fiscal consolidation frameworks need to be in place as soon as possible, particularly in the United States where the crisis has worsened debt dynamics on top of long-term pressures from entitlement spending",-1,
"In many countries, the elimination of tax expenditures can contribute to this objective",0,
Medium-term fiscal adjustment needs in emerging economies are generally smaller,-1,
"In particular, to reduce debt ratios to the precrisis median of 60 percent of GDP (net debt of 80 percent for Japan), the average projected adjustment of 3¾ percent of GDP between 2010 and 2016 amounts to less than half that needed through 2020",0,
"The key principles underlying fiscal consolidation plans, which may vary by country, should include: Flexible responses to macroeconomic conditions",-1,
"Developing good fiscal institutions that can provide accurate and timely monitoring of fiscal outturns, better coordination across levels of government, and more medium-term orientation of fiscal policy making, including by establishing and strengthening fiscal rules.",0,
Deficits in most advanced economies remain well above the levels that would stabilize or reduce debt ratios,0,
Fiscal adjustment in most advanced economies is broadly appropriate,0,
"Thus, it is important for advanced economies to move early to curtail rising age- and healthrelated spending to ensure debt sustainability.",-1,
"In the event of large negative shocks or growth disappointments, the current fiscal policy stance may need to be reassessed in countries that can afford it",1,
"Despite progress made so far, United States policymakers should agree on a comprehensive plan that includes both higher revenues and contains entitlement spending",-1,
Countries facing higher debt or greater market pressure are generally adjusting more than their advanced economy peers,0,
Fiscal adjustment must be supported by the adoption and implementation of concrete medium-term consolidation plans,-1,
"More generally, in advanced economies, growth in public health care spending is on an unsustainable trajectory (with projections indicating increases in net present value terms of close to 100 percent of GDP)",0,
"Fiscal targets should be pursued in structural rather than nominal terms, ensuring that negative growth surprises do not trigger additional consolidation efforts (in the euro area, the current fiscal framework provides sufficient flexibility and should be used appropriately)",0,
Policymakers need to focus on following issues: United States authorities should act early and decisively to find a durable solution to raising the debt ceiling and avert automatic spending cuts,0,
The recently-announced stimulus by Japan makes this even more urgent,-1,
"If a resolution is not found, confidence in United States policymakers could rapidly erode, with potentially large spillovers to the rest of the world",0,
Fiscal consolidation needs to continue at a gradual and sustained pace,-1,
Some reforms to overhaul EU governance have been proposed,0,
Addressing the fiscal situation in United States and Japan requires balancing short-run growth fragility with long-term sustainability concerns,0,
"For Europe as a whole, further policy measures are needed to address weaknesses in national budgetary institutions and procedures that have undermined past efforts to enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, such as a lack of transparency and medium-term orientation, as well as an optimistic bias in some national official forecasts",0,
But authorities should implement credible medium-term fiscal adjustment plans that include entitlement and revenue-raising tax reforms,-1,
"The weak growth outlook in Greece and Portugal imply, notably in the presence of financing constraints, the need for fiscal adjustment measures, as agreed in the EC-IMF programs for these economies",0,
They need to be legislated and implemented expeditiously,0,
"In addition to structural policies and temporary financial assistance, front-loaded fiscal adjustment is needed to restore market confidence and ease the pressure on sovereign and bank spreads",-1,
Fiscal Policy: Resolve the Sovereign Crisis and Adopt Credible Mediumterm Frameworks A long-term solution to problems in peripheral euro area economies requires a range of measures,-1,
"For the United States, it is critical to immediately raise the debt ceiling.",1,
Managing high public debt in a low-growth and low-inflation environment remains a key challenge in many economies,0,
Joint efforts by deficit and surplus economies to rebalance global demand would reduce excess external imbalances while sustaining growth,0,
"In the United States, the priority remains to agree on a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, including higher tax revenue",-1,
"Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, including through increased infrastructure investment",1,
"In advanced economies, accommodative monetary policy remains essential",0,
Growth-friendly fiscal rebalancing could include lower marginal taxes on labor and capital financed by cuts to unproductive spending or base-broadening measures,0,
"Notably, raising actual and potential growth remains a key objective",0,
"In the euro area, countries should adhere to their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), but those with fiscal space, notably Germany, could do more to encourage growth, especially by undertaking much-needed public infrastructure investment and supporting structural reforms",1,
Fiscal consolidation should remain growth friendly and be anchored in credible medium-term plans,-1,
Fiscal policy should be growth friendly,1,
Structural reforms are needed to raise potential output in both advanced and emerging economies,0,
"In Japan, a credible medium-term strategy for fiscal adjustment with specific measures is urgently needed, given high public debt ratios.",-1,
"In many emerging economies, macroeconomic policy space to support growth is more limited, with inflation still above target in some economies, and fiscal positions weaker than desirable in others",0,
"At the same time, past fiscal consolidation has been heavily focused on tax increases and wage and public investment cuts, exacerbating the trend decline in public capital stocks",0,
"Specifically: In the United States, the December 2013 budget agreement was an encouraging example of bipartisanship and provided partial relief from the sequester",0,
"However, much more is needed to put the debt ratio on a downward path",-1,
Further progress is also needed in improving national fiscal governance in the context of recent fiscal institutions reforms in the euro area.,0,
"In the euro area, the overall fiscal stance planned for 2014 is neutral, although a number of countries are still tightening, even if at a slower pace",0,
"However, if low growth persists and monetary policy options are depleted, the flexibility in the current fiscal framework may need to be used to respond in these circumstances",1,
"In Japan, the decision to implement the first phase of the consumption tax increase sent a strong signal about the government’s resolve to tackle the country’s fiscal imbalances",0,
"However, it remains essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy, by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner and adopting a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan (including entitlement and tax reforms) that puts public debt on a downward path",-1,
"The implementation of the second stage of consumption tax rate increase in 2015 is of great importance, and should go ahead",-1,
"While debt ratios should start declining from 2015 onward, fiscal deficits remain high relative to pre-crisis levels and there is still some way to go to rebuild policy buffers and bring debt ratios to prudent levels",0,
"Fiscal consolidation should continue at a gradual pace, within the framework of concrete medium-term plans (notably in Japan and the United States)",-1,
the recent fiscal stimulus package increased the urgency of a concrete medium-term consolidation plan,-1,
"Consolidation should rely on a more balanced distribution of spending cuts, where revenue ratios are already high",-1,
"Going forward, the design of fiscal policy should be careful to support the long-run growth potential of the economies, including by enhancing infrastructure investment, which will also boost demand",1,
"Fiscal consolidation should continue at a gradual pace, while preserving the long-term growth potential of the economy",-1,
This is broadly appropriate,0,
"If, however, growth slows considerably, fiscal measures could be considered in the context of a credible consolidation strategy",-1,
Swift implementation—and an expansion—of the EU scheme to provide public and private investment would raise growth in the short and medium-term and have positive spillovers in the region,0,
"An early agreement on credible medium-term deficit reduction would provide the space to fund investments in infrastructure, to raise productivity and innovation, and enhance workers’ skills",1,
"Temporary costs related to refugee expenditures should generally be accommodated, and the compatibility with current fiscal targets assessed on a case-by-case basis",0,
"Where necessary, fiscal consolidation should remain growth-friendly and support policies that foster innovation and productivity, while protecting the most vulnerable",0,
"In the United States, while the recent bipartisan fiscal agreements was an important positive step, further fiscal efforts are needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium-term as interest rates gradually increase and the demographic transition intensifies",-1,
"To avoid over-reliance on monetary policy, near-term fiscal policy should support the recovery where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, focusing on investment",1,
"In Japan, a commitment to fiscal consolidation centered on a pre-announced path of gradual consumption tax hikes and a strengthening of fiscal institutions would create near-term policy space to maintain growth momentum.",0,
"In the euro area, countries with fiscal space should do more to support growth—for example, through infrastructure investment in Germany",1,
"Where public debt is high, commitments to credible medium-term consolidation plans can create policy space",-1,
"But beyond that, fiscal consolidation will need to gain rapid momentum, notably in advanced economies",-1,
"Ensuring fiscal sustainability depends on ensuring growth, and so the provision of fiscal support will need to be maintained until there are clear signs of a self-sustaining recovery",1,
"Hence, plans for fiscal consolidation should generally take priority, all else given",-1,
"In sequencing an exit from crisis-related policies, fiscal policy should generally take priority",-1,
Winding down fiscal stimulus measures will provide only about 2 percent of GDP,0,
"in the current juncture, inflationary pressures appear well contained",0,
These strategies should include: Clear timeframes to reduce gross debt-to-GDP ratios to sustainable levels,-1,
Fiscal measures that seek to increase economies’ medium-run growth potentials,0,
Strong fiscal policy frameworks and institutions with comprehensive coverage of the public sector,0,
"In many G-20 countries, restoring fiscal sustainability is a top priority and policy challenge, notably in light of the surge in government debt levels",-1,
Some major emerging economies will also need to return to medium-term fiscal considerations as the recovery is established,-1,
additional fiscal measures will therefore be needed,0,
"Against this backdrop, exiting from fiscal stimulus should in general take priority over other policies, particularly in advanced economies",-1,
"Entitlement reforms and improvements to tax and expenditure policies could help attain fiscal sustainability, while promoting medium-run growth",-1,
"In many advanced G-20 economies, authorities will need to urgently devise and communicate credible medium-term fiscal policy strategies",-1,
"Furthermore, fiscal policy adjustment typically has a long lead time relative to monetary policy",0,
"Formally adopting or strengthening fiscal rules with explicit fiscal targets and monitoring by independent fiscal agencies could help shore up the necessary broad consensus, anchoring expectations and guiding fiscal policy implementation over the medium-term.",-1,
"This is particularly important for the United States, given its systemically important role in global financial markets, but also for other advanced economies that can affect the sovereign risk premiums of other countries",0,
Accommodative monetary policy does not have such automatic consequences and can be reversed quickly,0,
"In many advanced G-20 economies, substantial consolidation will be needed to ensure fiscal sustainability, foster medium-and-long-term growth and restore fiscal space for future needs",-1,
Maintaining an expansionary fiscal stance has a direct impact on the build-up of debt,0,
"To return debt ratios in advanced economies to relatively more prudent levels—for example, 60 percent of advanced-economy GDP by 2030 (the median level of debt in advanced economies prior to the crisis)—requires adjustment of the order of 8.percentage points of GDP in the next ten years",0,
"Large negative growth surprises in euro area countries should not trigger additional consolidation efforts, which would be self-defeating",1,
"The pace of fiscal withdrawal in 2014–15 is broadly appropriate, but a concrete post-2015 fiscal consolidation plan remains urgently needed, which would allow more near-term flexibility to respond to downside risks",-1,
"Moreover, if deflation risks materialize and monetary policy options are depleted, the escape clauses in the fiscal framework may need to be used to respond in these circumstances",0,
The pace and composition of fiscal adjustment should be attuned to supporting both the recovery and long-term growth,1,
This strikes the right balance between demand support and debt reduction,0,
"The United States should also consider some changes to budget procedures to lessen fiscal policy uncertainty, including:  reaching bipartisan agreement on a clear and simple medium-term fiscal objective,  an automatic process that raises the debt ceiling once agreement is reached on the broad budget parameters, and  a budget cycle where annual spending levels are agreed for a two-year period",0,
"In the euro area, the overall fiscal stance is broadly neutral, although a number of countries are still tightening, even if at a slower pace",0,
"Specifically: In the United States, reaching an agreement on a credible, medium-term consolidation plan that puts debt on a downward trajectory should be a high priority",-1,
"Plans to lower the corporate tax rate would likely have growth benefits, but would require offsetting fiscal measures to prevent a further rise in fiscal risks.",0,
"In the absence of such a comprehensive agreement, efforts should still focus on identifying more modest opportunities to relax the near term budget envelope, paid for with future fiscal savings",0,
"At the same time, the design of fiscal policy should better support the long-run growth potential of the economy, including by enhancing infrastructure investment, provided that infrastructure needs have been identified, there is slack in the economy, monetary policy is accommodative, investment processes are relatively efficient, and debt-to-GDP ratios are not already high",1,
"In particular, frontloading infrastructure spending would be a good candidate, given the urgent need to upgrade the quality of United States infrastructure",1,
"This should include steps to contain health care costs, reform social security, and increase revenues",-1,
"Nevertheless, Germany, which has completed its fiscal consolidation, could afford to finance much-needed public investment in infrastructure, without violating fiscal rules",1,
"Fiscal consolidation should continue to proceed gradually, anchored in credible medium-term plans, which are still lacking in some countries (notably, in Japan and the United States)",-1,
Concerns that it could harm low-income households should be addressed through targeted subsidies instead of reducing tax rates on essential items,0,
"In Japan, the second stage of the consumption tax increase should proceed with a uniform rate (from 8 to 10 percent in October 2015)",-1,
"Reforms are particularly needed in the areas of labor and product and services markets, such as those that facilitate greater competition (and lower markups), lower hiring costs, reduce long-term unemployment (by facilitating re-entry), encourage job search, matching, and mobility, and eliminate dual labor markets.",0,
Plans should build on constructive ideas from the Fiscal Commission and others,0,
"It has thus become even more important to articulate a credible fiscal consolidation plan, including entitlement reforms, caps on discretionary spending, higher revenues through reforms of the tax system, and the establishment or strengthening of fiscal institutions",-1,
"In the near term, a solidifying of the recovery and diminishing deflationary risks in many large advanced economies creates room for current fiscal consolidation plans to be accelerated",0,
"The recently announced tax cuts in the United States are projected to only have a modest impact on growth outcomes, but have a large budgetary cost",0,
"In the advanced economies, the most urgent tasks are to alleviate financial stresses in the euro area, develop credible fiscal consolidation plans, boost job creation, and accelerate financial reforms",-1,
"In key surplus economies, overheating pressures can be alleviated by permitting currency appreciation, facilitating a healthy rebalancing from external to internal demand",0,
"Successful fiscal adjustment will require medium-term consolidation plans to be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competitiveness, particularly in the euro area and Japan",-1,
Greater commitment is needed to ensure that fiscal policies will restore medium-term debt sustainability in advanced economies,-1,
Cooperative and well-timed policy initiatives—to reduce vulnerabilities and rebalance growth— are needed to sustain the global recovery,0,
The key policy challenge in emerging economies is to keep overheating pressures in check and respond appropriately to capital inflows,0,
"Given recent stimulus measures, the United States and Japan need to strengthen their adjustment credentials by specifying the measures they intend to adopt to honor their commitments to reduce deficits and debt",-1,
These policies would raise potential growth and help to support fiscal solvency in the long term,0,
Those advanced economies that came under renewed market pressure should underscore their commitment to their deficit targets and set up contingency plans to ensure that adjustment goals are met,-1,
"The vulnerability of some sovereigns emphasizes the urgency of formulating credible, medium-term fiscal consolidation plans—not just for countries in the euro periphery, but also for other advanced economies",0,
"Given market pressures, some economies in the euro area will need to tighten fiscal policies more aggressively than expected, including through upfront measures, even if politically difficult",-1,
"In most advanced G-20 economies, fiscal tightening will be required in 2011",-1,
The challenge for fiscal policy is to reduce high public debt to prudent levels while also encouraging growth,0,
"Fiscal consolidation needs to be anchored by a credible medium-term plan, with adjustment in the near-term depending on country circumstances, particularly the pace of recovery and the risk of a loss of fiscal credibility",-1,
Greater global policy coordination— especially on crisis resolution mechanisms—is needed to resolve the crisis on a durable basis,0,
Fiscal measures must also be complemented by measures to reduce the fragility of banking systems and by growth-enhancing structural reforms,0,
Countries that are unable to credibly commit to medium-term consolidation may find that adverse market reaction compels them to undertake significantly more front-loaded adjustment.,0,
"From a near-term perspective, most G-20 advanced economies do not need to tighten before 2011, since this could undermine the fledgling recovery, but they should not add further stimulus",0,
"For example, gradual increases in the age of eligibility for pensions would have immediate benefits for fiscal sustainability while allowing households time to adjust to longer expected working lives",0,
"It is of overarching importance that G-20 countries commit now to credible medium-term fiscal adjustment plans, which could include legislation creating multi-year targets",-1,
The recent turmoil in euro area debt markets highlights growing market sensitivity to sovereign risks,0,
"Medium-term reforms should also include strengthening fiscal institutions (for example, fiscal rules and medium-term fiscal frameworks) to support a durable fiscal effort",-1,
"In particular, authorities need to avoid both a loss of credibility arising from appearing unable or unwilling to address market concerns about the course of fiscal policy and an excessive tightening of fiscal policy in the near term, as either would have severe implications for growth",0,
The challenge for fiscal policy is to reduce public debt while also encouraging growth,0,
"The important consolidation steps taken by a number of these countries will need to be complemented with reform to the euro area fiscal framework, including deficit rules that have credible enforcement mechanisms",-1,
Countries currently facing sovereign funding pressures have already begun to embark on immediate fiscal consolidation,0,
"In elaborating medium-term fiscal adjustment, legislating reforms to pension entitlements and public health care systems, making permanent reductions in nonentitlement spending, and strengthening fiscal institutions would be imperative",-1,
"Although specifics will vary by country, current fiscal consolidation plans for this group of countries for 2011—which envisage, on average, an adjustment of about 1¼ percentage points of GDP in the cyclically adjusted balance—are broadly appropriate",0,
Short-term adjustment must be calibrated appropriately,-1,
Policy makers must aim to nurture short-term recovery and have credible medium-term adjustment plans to help anchor expectations and gain flexibility,1,
"In Japan, the recent fiscal stimulus makes developing a credible fiscal plan that stabilizes and reduces debt even more urgent",-1,
Fiscal tightening must continue at a pace that preserves the recovery,-1,
It will create greater scope to pursue supportive monetary policy without triggering concern about central bank independence or a resurgence of inflation.,0,
Comprehensive and ambitious consolidation plans and entitlement reform are instrumental given tradeoffs facing fiscal policy,-1,
"However, some advanced economies where private demand has been chronically disappointing should consider smoothing the pace of consolidation, if they have the room for maneuver",1,
"In the United States, agreement on a credible fiscal roadmap could help create some short-term policy space, mitigate risks of excessive near-term consolidation, and ease the burden currently placed on monetary policy",1,
"More generally, if growth surprises on the upside policymakers should reduce headline deficits faster, aiming for fiscal balances in cyclically-adjusted or structural terms",-1,
"In the United Kingdom, for example, greater flexibility in the pace of near-term fiscal consolidation should be considered given the weak recovery owing to lackluster demand",1,
"Progress on medium-term fiscal reform would also help quell concerns about political pressure on central banks to keep interest rates too low longer than warranted, given the massive purchases by various central banks of government paper since 2008",0,
The pace and composition of fiscal adjustment should be calibrated carefully to avoid an excessive drag on growth and be anchored by credible and concrete medium-term plans,1,
"In the United States, while private demand has gained momentum, this year’s large fiscal consolidation is excessive in light of the still nascent recovery",0,
"In the near term, a more gradual pace of fiscal adjustment would be preferable, but conditional on having a credible and specific medium-term consolidation plan in place",1,
"Consolidation should be based on an efficient and “growth-friendly” mix of expenditure and revenue measures, supported by appropriate structural reforms that enhance potential growth",1,
"Similarly, in Japan, despite an expansionary fiscal stance this year, substantial consolidation is in the pipeline for the next two years as a result of the two-step increase in the consumption tax rate to 10 percent and the waning of stimulus and reconstruction spending",0,
"In Japan, the implementation of the planned consumption tax increase next year is critical to maintain confidence in the ability of the government to address the fiscal problem",-1,
Financial sector reforms also need to be urgently completed,0,
Supporting growth and creating jobs is the main challenge in the major advanced economies,0,
Financial sector support measures also burdened fiscal accounts in some countries,0,
"In the United Kingdom, it is important that fiscal policy supports the nascent recovery by pursuing fiscal measures that would alleviate supply-side constraints and also provide support for private demand—within the context of its medium-term fiscal framework.",1,
"Broadly speaking, monetary policy accommodation should continue to play its supportive role, given low inflation and still large output gaps, and fiscal adjustment should be measured, while being anchored by a credible medium-term roadmap for sustainability",0,
"In the euro area, the extension of the EDP deadlines and the assessment of adjustment in structural terms are welcome, but the extra space should be used to act decisively on fiscal and structural reforms",0,
"Despite sizable consolidation efforts, fiscal imbalances remain large in advanced economies due to weak growth and unfavorable initial fiscal positions with respect to sustainability",0,
"The growth disappointments in turn partly reflected the negative effect of fiscal adjustment on shortterm growth and the fact that in some countries (France, Spain, UK), private demand has not been picking up from public demand",0,
"With such a plan in place, some fiscal space would be created to smooth the fiscal adjustment in 2014–15 should growth disappoint",1,
The debt ceiling should be raised expeditiously and a multi-year consolidation plan that tackles entitlement and tax reforms should also be adopted to restore long-run fiscal sustainability,-1,
"An ambitious and concrete consolidation plan beyond 2015, based equally on revenue and spending, is also urgently needed",-1,
"In advanced economies, macroeconomic policies should support growth",0,
"Spain needs a credible and detailed medium-term plan, while France needs to rebalance adjustment toward expenditure containment",-1,
"Specifically: In the United States, the budget sequester should be replaced by a more balanced and gradual pace of fiscal consolidation in the short term, with more efficient and targeted spending cuts",-1,
"At the same time, the design of fiscal policy should support growth, including by enhancing infrastructure investment (see Annex) where needs have been identified, there is slack in the economy, and investment processes are relatively efficient (for example, Germany and the United States)",1,
In response to negative growth surprises in the euro area flexibility within the fiscal governance framework could and should be used where possible to avoid triggering additional consolidation efforts,1,
"Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, with the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment—where needed—attuned to supporting the recovery",1,
"When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, short-run demand effects are stronger, and the boost in output can lead to a decline in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio",0,
"Fiscal consolidation should proceed gradually, anchored in credible medium-term plans, which are lacking in some countries (notably Japan and the United States)",-1,
"Provided that there is space, a supportive fiscal stance can help offset short-term adverse effects of structural reforms on aggregate demand, bringing forward the growth benefits",0,
"Finally, the pace of fiscal withdrawal in 2014–15 is broadly appropriate in Japan, but a post-2015 consolidation plan remains needed.",-1,
"In the euro area, flexibility within the fiscal governance framework should be used to support key structural reforms and public investment",0,
"In many emerging market economies, macroeconomic policy space to support growth remains limited, but lower oil prices will alleviate inflationary pressures, allowing for a more gradual tightening of monetary policy",0,
"Advanced economies should maintain supportive policies, given still substantial output gaps and below-target inflation",0,
"For oil exporters, the need to adjust fiscal stance would depend on the scope of savings from past higher prices of oil and exchange rate regimes",0,
"Finally, credible medium-term consolidation plans remain needed in Japan and the United States.",-1,
Fiscal policy should be growth friendly,1,
"Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, including by increasing infrastructure investment",1,
"For countries with less policy space, exchange rate flexibility will be a critical buffer to the shock",0,
There is an urgent need for structural reforms to raise potential output in both advanced and emerging economies,0,
"The pace and composition of fiscal consolidation should be designed to support both the recovery and long-term growth, including by enhancing infrastructure investment in economies with identified needs, output gaps, and relatively efficient investment processes (for example, Germany, the United States)",1,
"Where there is space, supportive fiscal stance can bring forward the growth benefits of structural reform by helping offset short-term adverse effects",0,
Lower oil prices offer an opportunity to reform energy subsidies and taxes in both oil exporters and importers,0,
"In emerging economies as a group, no substantial consolidation is envisaged for this year or next",0,
Fiscal consolidation should be gradual and sustained,-1,
The amount of planned fiscal consolidation in advanced economies appears relatively sizable over the near term—consistent with high debt and the slight increase in economic growth projected in the WEO— although with significant differences across countries,0,
"At the moment, the United States lacks agreement on such a plan, and Japan’s plan needs to be strengthened further despite the recent welcome approval of a timetable for doubling the consumption tax rate",-1,
"It is important to move early to reduce the growth of aging-related expenditures—and while some measures have been enacted in Europe to reduce retirement costs, more can be done in all advanced economies, particularly to lower health-related spending",-1,
More robust fiscal frameworks would support the credibility of adjustment plans.,-1,
Fiscal adjustment must be anchored by concrete and ambitious medium-term consolidation plans,-1,
"On average, in advanced economies, the ratio of cyclically-adjusted general government balances to potential GDP is projected to improve by about ¾ percent of potential GDP in 2012 and 1 percent in 2013",0,
Adjustments would be required on both expenditure and revenue sides of the ledger,-1,
"Moreover, if contrary to the expectations a resolution is not found, confidence in United States policymakers will erode— which could have large domestic and international ramifications",0,
"In case of large negative shocks or growth disappointments, the pace of consolidation should be smoothed in countries that can afford it",1,
United States authorities should act early to avoid the fiscal cliff and raise the debt ceiling,0,
"Importantly, a last minute deal that relies on suboptimal fixes or largely ―kicks the can down the road‖ may ultimately prove harmful",0,
"While markets view a major disruption associated with these issues as a tail risk, the uncertainty about when and how they will be resolved may be weighing on demand",0,
It is essential to calibrate the pace of adjustment with both the state of the economy and funding pressures in mind,1,
"Considerable adjustment has already occurred, but many advanced economies still have a long way to go",0,
"Where financial conditions permit, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate, and fiscal targets should be specified in cyclically-adjusted or structural terms",1,
"This is advisable considering both the relative scales of policy adjustment required and managing risks to both economic and financial recovery: For most countries, the risks presented by keeping stimulus in place too long suggest that adjustment is a key priority",-1,
"This suggests that the timing of exits will be country specific, although coordination on some specific fronts is desirable",0,
"Current differences in monetary policy conditions could give rise to larger capital inflows to emerging market countries, accentuating the need for policies to encourage rebalancing the global sources of demand",0,
"There is also a need to ensure adequate recovery of the value of assets acquired during the crisis, cover any central bank losses, and manage contingent liabilities so as to minimize their realization.2",0,
"The general government balance should be targeted, as deficits and debts of subnational government institutions have the same macroeconomic and financial solvency effects as those of central governments",0,
High debt ratios would impede fiscal flexibility and raise interest rates,0,
"For most countries, fiscal consolidation should be a top priority, with monetary policy able to adjust more flexibly to achieve a desired level of overall stimulus",-1,
"Monetary policy can respond more quickly to achieve the desired level of overall stimulus, when fiscal retrenchment begins",0,
Commentary: Achieving fiscal sustainability will be a complex process and will take longer than normalizing monetary policy,0,
The appropriate debt ratio will need to take country-specific characteristics into account,0,
This suggests that fiscal policy changes that have long-term effects but that do not affect the economic recovery in the short term (such as entitlement reforms and strengthening fiscal frameworks and institutions) should be implemented soon to enhance credibility,-1,
"This includes the composition of the debt (currency and maturity), depth of domestic financial markets, and diversification of the investor base",0,
The strategy for fiscal consolidation should be outlined and communicated now,-1,
The principles laid out below are intended to establish common ground for the design and implementation of policies during the exit from extraordinary support measures taken during the crisis,0,
This is especially true for those economies facing rising pressure on public finances from key entitlement programs and demographic change,0,
"Exit strategies should pave the way for strong, stable and balanced economic growth",0,
monetary policy is more easily able to adjust to achieve the desired level of overall stimulus,0,
"Actions to bolster fiscal frameworks and institutions could include reforms of budgetary processes, more frequent and comprehensive reporting requirements, medium-term expenditure frameworks, and fiscal rules",-1,
"In many advanced economies, monetary policy can afford to remain accommodative for an extended period, given subdued price pressures",0,
"The achievement of sustained economic growth requires that the role of the public sector in the economy, including in the financial sector, be restored to one that supports private and market based financial intermediation",0,
"For many advanced economies, targeting a gradual return to a gross debt ratio below 60 percent (the median level before the crisis) would be appropriate, with reforms of entitlements, other expenditures, and revenues a prerequisite for attaining that target and maintaining it over time",-1,
Deficit-reducing and debt management measures should commence as soon as private demand begins recovering,-1,
Fiscal reforms that have long-term effects but that do not affect the economic recovery in the short-term (such as entitlement reforms) should thus be implemented soon to enhance credibility,-1,
Targets for emerging economies will need to take into account generally lower market tolerance for high public debt,0,
Commentary: A high degree of transparency in fiscal accounts is more important than ever,0,
"Targeting an appropriate debt ratio of GDP, taking into account longer-term spending pressures, would help build public awareness and address market concerns regarding fiscal sustainability: Stabilizing debt ratios at their likely post-crisis levels will not be sufficient",0,
"The scale of fiscal adjustment required to ensure fiscal sustainability will be large, particularly in advanced economies",-1,
"In a number of emerging economies, by contrast, monetary policy may have to tighten sooner—and might therefore be more synchronous with or even lead fiscal consolidation—if there are signs of rising inflation or incipient financial vulnerabilities, including credit booms",0,
Market based principles and pricing also can play a role in reducing the use of support measures prior to their full removal,0,
Maintaining fiscal stimulus longer than needed has obvious and immediate consequences for debt accumulation,0,
The challenges of placing fiscal policy on a sustainable path—both political and economic—are greater than for normalizing monetary policy,0,
"Requirements include a comprehensive assessment of fiscal risks, including those arising from possible additional support to the financial sector, volatility in interest rates, guarantees, and public-private partnerships",0,
"The scale of fiscal adjustment required is large to ensure debt sustainability and to restore room for policy maneuver, particularly in advanced economies",-1,
"High debt levels require better debt structures (for example, longer, well spread-out maturities)",0,
Measures to strengthen the finances and operations of subnational governments and public enterprises may also be needed in some countries,0,
"Formally adopting or strengthening fiscal rules with explicit fiscal targets and monitoring by independent fiscal agencies could help shore up the necessary broad consensus, anchoring expectations and guiding fiscal policy implementation over the medium-term.",-1,
"In the context of high unemployment, there may be merit in considering new policy initiatives aimed at boosting job creation in some countries",0,
"To achieve fiscal sustainability, authorities need a credible medium-term fiscal policy strategy that would entail: Clear timeframes to bring the gross debt to GDP ratio to sustainable levels that take into account longer-term spending pressures",-1,
A failure to implement these measures would threaten fiscal sustainability and reduce growth prospects,0,
"Moreover, they should start implementing immediately elements of these medium-term plans that do not impact negatively on demand",-1,
Maintaining an expansionary fiscal stance has a clear and direct impact on the build-up of debt,0,
Experience in past large consolidations indicates that this is the key element in a successful reduction of the debt ratio,0,
"the most important risk from this policy stance in the current low inflationary environment is the potential for liquidity spillovers, particularly to domestic asset markets and emerging economies",0,
"In the major advanced G-20 economies there will be a need for continued policy stimulus until private demand gathers sustainable momentum, as the recovery will remain sluggish and fragile, notwithstanding the recent uptick in growth prospects",0,
"Achieving fiscal sustainability will be a difficult and prolonged process, making it imperative for consolidation to begin as soon as there is clear evidence of self-sustaining recovery",-1,
Strong fiscal policy frameworks and institutions with comprehensive coverage of the public sector,0,
"Also, a tightening of the fiscal stance may help monetary and debt management, while a monetary tightening will contribute to a worsening of the fiscal position",-1,
"Maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance, which can be reversed quickly, has few obvious direct downsides",0,
"While provision of fiscal support will need to be maintained until the recovery gains a solid footing, advanced G-20 governments should lay out credible medium-term plans to reduce public debt ratios",-1,
"Hence, on balance fiscal consolidation should generally take priority, all else given",-1,
"This includes strengthening fiscal institutions to increase the likelihood that fiscal adjustment will take place, and undertaking those reforms of entitlement spending that do not depress consumption—such as increases in the retirement age—or that can be phased in gradually",-1,
"Winding down fiscal stimulus measures could provide only about 1½ percent of GDP—thus additional fiscal measures will be needed (for example, reform of pension and healthcare entitlements)",-1,
"Stabilizing debt ratios at their likely post-crisis levels will not be sufficient, as high debt ratios would impede fiscal flexibility, raise economy-wide interest rates, and constrain growth",0,
"However, such measures should be cast within a framework that ensures sound medium-term fiscal balances",0,
"In most advanced G-20 economies, ensuring fiscal sustainability is a key priority and policy challenge, notably in light of the surge in government debt levels",-1,
"Given a path for fiscal policies, monetary policy can be set to achieve a desired level of overall stimulus, tightening as needed to counter inflationary risks and maintain price stability",0,
"Central banks should maintain low interest rates for some time, given that underlying inflation is expected to remain subdued and unemployment high through 2010",0,
"The appropriate debt target will depend on economy-specific characteristics, including debt composition, depth of domestic financial markets, vulnerability to shocks, and diversification of the investor base",0,
"Fiscal policies need to remain supportive of economic activity in the near term, and the fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented fully",1,
"The fiscal impulse should start to be withdrawn in 2011, except in those economies where markets are rapidly losing confidence in fiscal sustainability and where tightening should start earlier",-1,
Sustained adjustment in primary structural balances,0,
"In advanced economies, the primary balance adjustment required over the next ten years to return debt ratios to about 60 percent of GDP (80 percent of GDP in Japan) by 2030 is of the order of 8 percentage points of GDP (from a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP in 2010 to a surplus of 4½ percent of GDP in 2020 and keeping it at that level for the following decade)",0,
"Short-term demand support still has an important part to play in advanced economies, but needs greater emphasis on growth-friendly fiscal policies",1,
"For the euro area, the use of centralized investment funds to support infrastructure investment in countries without fiscal space would be appropriate",0,
A coordinated use of fiscal space would be beneficial should the global outlook weaken materially,0,
"In the United States, achieving a sustained downward medium-term path for public debt would require a comprehensive reform of the tax system, pension reform, and further healthcare cost containment",0,
"In Japan, the pre-announcement of a gradual path of consumption tax hikes is needed",-1,
"In most countries, it will be important to adjust expenditure priorities to finance reforms that increase potential output (for example, Germany)",0,
"Strong fiscal frameworks that ensure sustainability over the longer term, coupled with fiscal reforms, help increase or safeguard policy space in the short run (for example, United States, Japan)",0,
"Where monetary policy space is narrowing and there is fiscal space, fiscal policy can help support demand and close output gaps—including through measures that will strengthen growth also in the medium and long term (for example, Canada, Korea) or, where necessary, facilitate balance sheet repair",1,
"In a majority of advanced countries, output gaps remain negative, weak labor markets threaten to permanently scar especially the young in the workforce, and inflation is low and far off target",0,
"Where monetary policy is becoming overburdened, domestic policy coordination can help to make macroeconomic support effective",0,
There is also a strong case for expanding centralized fiscal support.,0,
Advanced G-20 economies must articulate credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans with specific measures embedded in a realistic macroeconomic framework,-1,
"Credible medium-term fiscal plans, which would create space for providing further support for fledgling recovery, and well calibrated and appropriately paced fiscal adjustment in the near term to anchor investor confidence",-1,
This need to be supported by rapid implementation of structural reforms to raise growth and enhance debt sustainability,0,
This would create more policy space for nearterm support to growth and employment if needed,0,
"In the event of a further significant slowdown in growth, a number of these economies have scope to slow their current pace of consolidation, if offset by a commitment of additional tightening later",0,
"In most other advanced G-20 economies (for example, Australia, Canada, Germany, Korea, and the United Kingdom), current plans are appropriate, but near-term tightening should also slow if growth threatens to be substantially lower than projected, with compensating stronger medium-term adjustment",1,
"In the United States, the proposed American Jobs Act would provide needed near-term support",0,
"However, parallel and credible medium-term fiscal adjustment plan that raises revenues and contains the growth of entitlement spending remains essential",-1,
"Japan’s near-term fiscal stance is appropriate given the need to rebuild after the earthquake, but a comprehensive and ambitious plan to put public debt on a sustainable footing over the medium-term remains essential",-1,
Economies facing adverse private funding conditions—such as those with IMFand EU-supported programs—have little choice but to press ahead with current consolidation plans.,0,
"A more expansionary fiscal stance in Germany would not only allow a much-needed increase in public investment and raise potential output, it would also support external adjustment, while at the same time having positive spillovers to other euro area economies where there is still cyclical slack",1,
"Where fiscal space is available, fiscal policy can help foster innovation and structural change in labor, product, and services markets, including through demand support for certain reforms",0,
"In the United States, monetary policy should continue to gradually normalize and remain data dependent, and plans for the Fed’s balance sheet should be well-communicated",0,
"Countries with limited fiscal space can provide support in a budget- neutral manner (for example, by using savings from unemployment benefit reforms to improve job training programs)",0,
"Fiscal policy can also ease the adjustment of those adversely affected by technological change or increasing economic integration (for example, job counseling and retraining, apprenticeship programs for youth, support for life-long learning, measures in areas such as housing, credit, and infrastructure to increase mobility)",0,
"fiscal policy should ensure that the ratio of debt to GDP is on a downward path, while supporting the longer-term potential of the economy",-1,
It can protect the vulnerable through better-targeted social safety nets financed by well- designed progressive taxes,0,
"In contrast, where inflation is still below central bank targets and output gaps remain negative, monetary policy should stay supportive (Japan, euro area) and available fiscal space should be used actively to provide further additional support",1,
"In countries where fiscal adjustment is needed to avoid destabilizing debt dynamics and rebuild policy buffers, consolidation is appropriate and should be supported by growth-friendly measures (for example, in Italy)",-1,
"Where tradeoffs occur, fiscal policy can play a mitigating role",0,
"Ongoing IMF work and country experiences also suggest that the use of digital technology holds the potential for better targeted and efficient fiscal policy, ensuring a reduction in spending leakages and greater transparency.",0,
"To secure a strong and durable recovery, policies need a decisive upgrade",0,
Raising both actual and potential output through a combination of demand support and structural reforms remains a key policy objective,0,
Fiscal consolidation should remain growth friendly and be anchored in credible medium-term plans supported by well-designed fiscal frameworks,-1,
"Fiscal policy should be more supportive where conditions allow, even as credible plans to reduce public debt ratios over the longer run are put in place",1,
"Helping China in its difficult transition will also reduce tail risks and facilitate stronger, more durable global growth",0,
"In advanced economies, accommodative monetary policy remains essential",0,
Joint efforts by deficit and surplus economies to rebalance global demand would reduce excess external imbalances while sustaining growth,0,
"The aim should be to put debt on a downward path, based on realistic assumptions and identifying specific revenue and expenditure measures.",0,
"Many emerging economies have limited scope for monetary and fiscal policy to support growth, with inflation still above target in some economies, and fiscal positions weaker than desirable in others",0,
"Where feasible, exchange rate flexibility should serve as a shock absorber, with a temporary role for both intervention and capital flow management measures when market conditions turn disorderly",0,
"Fiscal policy should be more supportive where conditions allow, even as credible medium-term budget plans are put in place",1,
Collective effort is also required to further enhance global safety nets and strengthen the International Monetary System,0,
Public debt levels are at historic highs,0,
"In the euro area, countries should adhere to their commitments under EU fiscal rules, but those with fiscal space, notably Germany and the Netherlands, could do more to encourage growth, especially through much-needed public infrastructure investment and supporting structural reforms",1,
"In Japan, the announced medium-term fiscal consolidation plan provides a useful anchor to guide fiscal policy",-1,
It should also protect the most vulnerable,0,
"In the United States, the priority remains to agree on a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to prepare for rising aging-related costs, including higher tax revenue",-1,
"The recent Congressional passage of a two-year budget, including a suspended debt ceiling, is a critical step to support the economy",0,
"These measures will create policy room to support balance sheet repair, growth, and job creation during this period of heightened vulnerability.",0,
"Sufficient near-term fiscal adjustment has begun in most advanced economies, including in the euro area",0,
"Depending on circumstances, measures could include entitlement reforms including new health care and pension saving measures, and tax system reforms to boost fiscal revenue",-1,
"Overdoing fiscal adjustment in the short run will undermine activity, diminish popular support for adjustment, and further threaten market confidence",0,
"Fiscal consolidation, structured and paced to avoid a collapse in demand and ensure debt sustainability, must continue in many euro area countries, and laying out credible medium-term adjustment plans remains an urgent priority in key advanced economies",-1,
"Countries with fiscal space, especially those with very low funding costs, should consider slowing fiscal adjustment in 2012, while maintaining their commitment to a credible medium-term consolidation plan",1,
"Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate freely, provided funding for higher deficits can be secured",1,
Euro area members benefiting from a financial assistance program should stick to the agreed consolidation efforts and should fully implement the required structural reforms,-1,
"Policymakers should increase efforts to formulate and implement credible consolidation plans, particularly in the United States and Japan",-1,
There is however significant cross-country variation in the calculations,0,
"To avoid an overly abrupt global adjustment at the global level, policies will need to be considered across the G-20 when the time for tightening comes.",0,
"However, these targets are relatively far in the future",0,
"Overall fiscal deficits remain larger in 2014 (even though the output gap is projected to largely close), compared with 2007, by around 21⁄2 percentage points of GDP for the advanced countries and 2 percentage points for the emerging markets",0,
"Some are exploring new fiscal rules, such as Germany, which is considering a new constitutional rule for structural balance limits at the federal and state levels",0,
"For the emerging markets, revenue gains in some countries offset sustained lowered commodity revenues (from exceptionally high 2007 levels) in others",0,
"The strategies should include reforming entitlements, fiscal consolidation, and other structural fiscal reforms: Pension and health care reforms will be critical to address key sources of fiscal pressures over the next few decades",-1,
"The publication of ten-year fiscal forecasts by the United States is a welcome step, including by increasing transparency",0,
Most G-20 countries are counting on a revival of tax revenues and a reversal of discretionary spending initiatives when conditions improve (Table 6),0,
and governments should ensure adequate recovery of the value of financial assets acquired during the crisis,0,
"The later the fiscal adjustment starts, the larger will be the required primary balance to return to the pre-crisis debt-levels",0,
"However, it will be difficult to resolve fiscal problems simply by relying on improvements in cyclical revenue, as some of the revenue base may have been lost permanently (for example, from elevated profits in the financial sector or real estate)",0,
"Against these trends, a natural question is the extent of fiscal adjustment that would be required to return debt-to-GDP ratios to pre-crisis levels",0,
"Finally, demographic pressures continue to build, with consequences for health and pension outlays and medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability",0,
Fiscal policy should be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms,1,
Increases in primary expenditures offset modest projected savings on interest payments,0,
"The technical and political groundwork for feasible reform solutions should proceed now, particularly with respect to health reforms, where difficult and complex choices are involved",0,
"Others are considering less formal, non-binding targets for public debt or deficits that would demand significant sustained adjustment",0,
"Given the WEO baseline for growth and the debt trajectory, and assuming that adjustment begins in 2011 and takes place over a 10-year period, illustrative calculations suggests that the required primary surplus-to-GDP ratio is 3.percent, requiring an average adjustment of 5.percent of GDP",0,
"Delaying the start of adjustment by even one year raises the required primary surplus over the ten-year period to 4.percent of GDP, and the required average adjustment to 5.percent of GDP",0,
"With fiscal pressures, governments will need to do “more with the same,” if not “more with (perhaps significantly) less.” Improved fiscal policy frameworks— rules, responsibility laws, and councils—could play a role to bolster credibility, depending on country specifics",-1,
Staff estimates that the net present value of future entitlement spending increases is ten times larger than the fiscal costs of the current crisis,0,
Other elements will be important: tax policies should avoid excessive tax competition and a race to the bottom,0,
"Like financial systems, public finances will need to adjust over the medium-term",0,
"however, projections for growth and interest rates appear optimistic",0,
Action is all the more critical in that progress in one key pillar of a strategy to address these pressures— reducing budget deficits and lowering public debt levels in the short term to make room for future entitlement spending increases—has been undermined by the crisis,-1,
"Fiscal deficits will need to be consolidated to bring public finance back on a sustainable trajectory, particularly with looming demographic pressures on spending",-1,
"For emerging economies, the projected medium-term debt path is more benign, owing to higher growth",0,
"For the advanced countries, this reflects higher interest payments in 2014 (by nearly 2 percentage points of GDP, on average), as well as higher primary expenditures",0,
"Most of this increase occurs in the advanced countries, which would see a rise in their debt ratio of 36 percentage points over this period, with more than 4/5 of the increase accounted for by the impact of automatic stabilizers, weaker asset prices, fiscal stimulus and financial sector support measures, and higher interest payments (Table 4)",0,
"Where consolidation policies have been mooted, they have focused on increases in taxation of fuel and on making income taxes more progressive, and in some cases on limiting growth of current spending or cutting capital expenditure",0,
"Not renewing stimulus will reduce deficits, but not public debt",0,
"Also, gains from “unwinding” fiscal and financial support operations are uncertain, as in some countries significant political capital will need to be expended to ensure that stimulus measures do not become permanent",0,
