"In China , macro policies need to be adjusted for a moderate slowdown , allowing growth to settle at a sustainable level",
"Specifically , implementing the 2010 quota and governance reforms , including their elements , is imperative to provide the resources , credibility , and legitimacy",
the Fund needs to play an effective role in overseeing the IMS .,
"Short-term demand support still has an important part to play in advanced economies , but needs greater emphasis on fiscal policies",
"Like fiscal policy , the pace of financial reform to safeguard stability such as higher capital and liquidity buffers should be carefully calibrated to support bank lending and real growth ,",
while avoiding unnecessary delays,
that can be a source of regulatory uncertainty,
that can deter the willingness to lend,
"In emerging markets , wherever possible , policymakers should continue to let",
the exchange rate act as a buffer against shocks,
"Nonetheless , they still remain wider than their levels , partly signifying the limits of central bank liquidity operations",
"Where room exists , policy rates should be cut further",1
and central banks should signal that interest rates will remain low,1
until a durable recovery is in sight,1
"Libor-OIS spreads have declined sharply , reflecting increased liquidity and lower credit risk",
"Where still high inflationary pressures persist , including from supply bottlenecks for example , Brazil , India , and Indonesia , the scope for easing the monetary stance may be very limited or it may need to be tightened",1
"In the euro area , countries with fiscal space should do more to support growth for example , through infrastructure investment in Germany",
"This process will benefit from continuing macroeconomic support including , for example , through the use of tax incentives and by providing protection for vulnerable households",
"In Japan , a commitment to fiscal consolidation centered on a path of gradual consumption tax hikes and a strengthening of fiscal institutions would create policy space to maintain growth momentum",
Monetary and fiscal policies can be used to reduce inflows,
where further reserve accumulation or exchange rate appreciation are not warranted,
Monetary policy should be the first response to spillovers from advanced economies,
as long as inflationary pressures remain in check,
Joint efforts by deficit and surplus economies to rebalance global demand would reduce excess external imbalances while sustaining growth,
"In Japan , the Bank of Japan should stand ready for further easing , preferably by extending purchases under its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing program to assets",1
the proposed adjustments to the policy mix would also contribute to more sustainable growth,
"At the same time , policymakers can raise confidence by explaining to citizens the benefits of reform and ,",
"where necessary , providing effective support to those",
who disproportionately shoulder the burden of adjustment,
"While lower oil prices should boost domestic demand , accommodative monetary conditions remain essential in most advanced economies , given still sizable output gaps",
"Specifically : On the monetary front , economies",
"where inflation is still relatively high , or",
"where policy credibility has come into question , need to continue tightening monetary policy in the context of strengthened policy frameworks India and Turkey .",1
Recent IMF research shows,
that structural reforms are most effective,
"when they directly address an economy 's known structural policy gaps and take account of its level of development , its position in the business cycle , and the available macroeconomic policy space",
The financial sector remains the Achilles ' heel of recovery prospects for private demand,
Swift implementation and an expansion of the EU scheme to provide public and private investment would raise growth in the short and and have positive spillovers in the region,
"In the United States , while underlying growth has been relatively robust , there is still a long way to go on the labor market ,",
as unemployment remains high and labor force participation below trends,
The main challenge for policymakers is to act forcefully to address downside risks with strong policy implementation,
Central banks must decide,
"what more , if anything , to do and prepare for an eventual exit from unconventional monetary policies",1
International cooperation is needed to achieve more orderly resolution across borders and consistent regulatory frameworks and supervision,
In economies facing high inflationary pressures,
"reducing interest rates is not an attractive option ,",
while both political considerations and implementation lags may limit the scope for fiscal consolidation .,
"Monetary policies can be eased in economies with diminishing inflationary pressure but weaker fiscal fundamentals for example , various economies in Latin America",1
"However , where shares of food and energy in consumption are high and policy credibility is low ,",
"as is more common , authorities will have to react faster and more strongly .",
Public debt is above pre in most countries and structural issues and lower potential output point to lower fiscal space than previously estimated,
and debt management measures should commence as soon,
as private demand begins recovering,
"However , the timing of the increase in policy rates may have to be adjusted in function of developments on the inflation and unemployment fronts",1
"This requires a approach combining all available policy tools and strong policy frameworks ,",
which anchor fiscal and monetary policy in the long run while allowing for effective demand management in the short run,1
Advanced economies should strengthen regulation and supervision of financial activities outside the banking system,
which are expanding rapidly,
Exploiting synergies between support and structural reforms is even more crucial,
where fiscal space is limited and monetary policy operates close to the effective lower bound,1
The composition of central bank assets will in part determine the approach to be taken .,1
"In this context , the recent formal adoption of a symmetrical inflation target by India should provide a robust institutional foundation for maintaining price stability",1
"Monetary policy should remain accommodative in advanced economies ,",1
as output gaps are large and fiscal consolidation will continue,
There is an urgent need for structural reforms to raise potential output in both advanced and emerging economies,
In such cases the combination of temporary macroeconomic support by credible policy frameworks with structural reforms can deliver more than the sum of its parts,
"Where interest rates are at or near their effective lower bounds , fiscal policy must play a larger role",
"Some countries for example , Argentina and India should remain watchful of inflationary pressures and can not afford to lower interest rates further",
"However , the impact of policy rates reductions on credit conditions , including notably on borrowing rates , has been limited by financial disruptions",
"that have weakened the monetary transmission mechanism , with banks continuing to tighten lending standards , albeit at a slower pace more recently",
Many exporters for which oil receipts typically contribute to a sizable share of fiscal revenues are experiencing large shocks in proportion to their economies,
"However , given the unevenness of the recovery across economies , challenges faced by central banks are different",
"In Japan , the implementation of the Bank of Japan 's BoJ October announcement of expanded Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing QQE framework by accelerating purchases of JGBs and extending their maturity and tripling the purchases of private assets remains critical to support domestic demand",
"In Japan , the introduction of negative deposit rates by the BoJ underscores its commitment to maintain inflation momentum",
"It is important , however , to consider macroeconomic conditions",
when implementing reforms,
"Ultimately , in some European cases , this may well entail the use of pooled euro area resources , including EFSF funds",
"The adverse feedback loops between low growth , deteriorating public finances , and banking sector stress could lead to a prolong period of asset and consumer price deflation",
"In economies where monetary policy is still very accommodative and inflation above target , some monetary policy tightening may be needed to bring inflation back to target",1
"The recent large expansion of central bank balance sheets is mirrored in the growth of bank reserves ,",
which will need to be mopped up,
as interest rates are raised to ensure the transmission of policy rate changes to the real economy,
Policy priorities have taken on more urgency compared to the February Surveillance Note,
"Finally , to the extent that fiscal and monetary policies are adjusted to make growth more balanced and reduce vulnerabilities, they will also decrease the risk of crisis , and thereby , make growth more lasting and sustainable .",
The quality of fiscal consolidation in India should be improved through a comprehensive tax reform such as introducing the goods and services tax and improving tax administration and measures to further reduce subsidies,
"In some emerging markets , the task is to avoid overheating and prevent the of financial imbalances",
It will create greater scope to pursue supportive monetary policy without triggering concern about central bank independence or a resurgence of inflation,
"However , where financing conditions are easing and exchange rates have appreciated",
there may be scope for with limited policy easing to support a resumption of growth,
central banks will need eventually to unwind their extraordinary liquidity support and withdraw conventional and unconventional monetary accommodation,
Unwinding should be tractable and central,
"banks have the tools needed to tighten policy , but there will be challenges",
"However , the global financial safety net remains underused during periods of turbulence , with uneven access and a multilayered structure for example , regional financing arrangements , bilateral swap lines , and Fund financing",
Accommodative monetary policy does not have such automatic consequences and can be reversed quickly,
"The new government should complement the proposed cap on federal noninterest spending with tax measures and address spending rigidities and unsustainable mandates , including in the pension system",
"Following the IMF 's Article IV policy advice , countries with negative output gaps",
"which have fiscal space should support growth with all available tools ,",
while those with closed output gaps should withdraw fiscal stimulus and calibrate monetary policy to inflation developments,
"In most advanced economies , output gaps are still substantial , inflation is below target , and monetary policy remains",
constrained by the zero lower bound,
Sustaining the recovery will require structural reforms to raise potential growth along with demand support .,
"In a number of emerging economies , by contrast , monetary policy may have to tighten sooner and might therefore be more synchronous with or even lead fiscal consolidation",1
"if there are signs of rising inflation or incipient financial vulnerabilities , including credit booms",
"In emerging economies , there remains scope to cut policy rates",1
"if needed to support demand , but rising asset prices and a vigorous turnaround in economic activity suggest",
that policy tightening may be needed in some countries,1
"In the euro area building on OMT and ESM activation , further action is also needed to strengthen banks , address structural shortcomings and complete EMU",
Authorities can afford to be more accommodative in those economies,1
where the credibility of monetary policy is high,
"this objective will require meeting the onerous challenges to fiscal sustainability , normalizing monetary policy carefully withdrawing financial sector support , and avoiding policy inconsistencies across countries , as well as in the policy mix",
"Continued demand rebalancing from deficit to surplus economies would strengthen global growth and ,",
"if done properly , would help resolve their internal imbalances",
"Broadly speaking , monetary policy accommodation should continue to play its supportive role , given low inflation and still large output gaps , and fiscal adjustment should be measured , while being anchored by a credible roadmap for sustainability",1
The pace and composition of fiscal adjustment should be attuned to supporting both the recovery and growth,
"Also , the ECB should continue to provide liquidity and stay fully engaged in securities purchases to help improve the prospects for financial stability",1
The strengthening of activity in advanced economies and looming normalization of monetary policy in some implies,
that external financial conditions both availability of capital flows and borrowing costs will eventually tighten,
"Additionally , to sustain recovery in these countries some of the consolidation planned for 2011 might also have to be temporarily postponed",
"In the United Kingdom , a range of recent monetary and other policy measures by the Bank of England will support the economy and thereby mitigate downside risks",
The recent forward guidance provided by the ECB to anchor interest rate expectations was a welcome step,
Monetary policy should continue to aid recovery,
"Completing the reform of financial regulation and deploying tools as a first line of defense ,",
"as needed , are essential to limit financial risks",
"Circumstances vary across emerging markets , but many should act to restore fiscal buffers over time , use monetary policy to guard against downside risks , and rely on measures to safeguard financial stability",
Emerging economies need to rebuild policy space and,
in some cases address domestic imbalances and vulnerabilities to prepare for tighter financial conditions,
To facilitate rebalanced global growth : advanced economies with large current account deficits should transition towards measures to raise savings,
"Episodes of volatile capital flows and exchange rates , along with continuing precautionary reserve accumulation , also suggest the need for further collective efforts to strengthen the IMS",
"More fiscal stimulus in advanced surplus economies with fiscal space , continuing monetary support and fiscal rebalancing in deficit economies , and structural reforms would contribute to external rebalancing",
"Concern about asset values and risky exposures should be addressed by forcing banks to build capital buffers ,",
while unviable business models need to be unwound,
The recent Council agreement on the SRM is a step forward,
"but the process appears complex , and may cause delays in decision making",
"In many advanced economies , insufficient progress with repair and reform is weighing on credit growth , and slowing the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies , with adverse spillovers on emerging economies , through large and volatile capital flows",
"Better central bank communications may help bring down real interest rates and provide added support to demand , including by reassuring markets against premature tightening",
"Exiting from public support policies should be viewed in the context of bridging towards strong , sustained and balanced growth with price stability",
"To ensure transmission of tighter monetary conditions to the real economy , central banks will also need to withdraw excess bank reserves created by their exceptional liquidity provision and unconventional measures",1
advanced and emerging economies can start tightening policies now,1
and greater confidence in policymakers ' ability to act decisively,
"There is a clear case for the Fed to proceed along a very gradual upward path for the fed funds rate , conscious of global disinflationary trends and confirming along the way",
that wage and price inflation are indeed maintaining their steady upward momentum,
"It would also be beneficial to reorient spending notably , to protect vulnerable sections of society against commodity price increases",
"At the same time , however , policymakers should be mindful of the impact of such action on other economies , notably through large and volatile capital flows",
"Furthermore , fiscal policy adjustment typically has a long lead time relative to monetary policy",
It should also consider providing stronger guidance to markets by moving to more monetary policy communication to increase the transparency of its assessment of inflation prospects and strengthen the signal of its commitment to the inflation target,
"For instance , streamlining service or product sector regulations in surplus economies for example , in Japan , Korea , and Germany will encourage domestic demand and relative price adjustments",
"It will also make systemic institutions more resilient , help contain asset price and credit dynamics , and cushion",
the consequences of liquidity squeezes if volatility spikes,
"A tightening cycle has begun in other advanced economies for example , Australia , Canada , Korea , but these central banks have signaled caution in further tightening given",
increased downside risks to the global economy,
Policymakers should employ appropriate macro and tools to mitigate such outcomes,
"At the same time , progress on other fronts is crucial",
The problems facing the global economy are complex and joint action can help,
"Over the medium run , priority should be given to completing the banking union , strengthening the single market , and moving closer to a fiscal union",
"Depending on country needs , comprehensive action will combine structural reforms with demand support , anchored by coherent and policy frameworks",
"This is becoming increasingly relevant for many emerging economies , notably in Asia ,",
that are already witnessing relatively vigorous rebounds of activity,
Fiscal tightening should also be the priority,
"where stimulus measures have contributed directly to a strong rebound in domestic demand , or",
where market concerns regarding public debt sustainability are high or rising,
Monetary easing can be the first line of defense against liquidity pressures and downside risks,
"where inflation is firmly anchored ,",
"although capital flow reversals , external financing needs , and financial stability risks might constrain scope for action in some countries",
"In the United States , improving the transmission of the monetary easing",
would require resolution of the household debt overhang,
Prudential authorities will need to be watchful of risks flowing from low interest rates,
In some advanced economies that have fiscal space and are operating at or close to capacity ,
additional spending could boost potential growth and create positive transitional spillovers for others,
"In the United States and the United Kingdom , where the recovery is stronger",
the challenge is to manage exit from exceptionally accommodative monetary policies,
as output gaps shrink,
"In the United States , agreement on a credible fiscal roadmap could help create some policy space , mitigate risks of excessive consolidation , and ease the burden currently placed on monetary policy",
"A key to addressing this challenge is to expeditiously reform and repair financial sectors in the major advanced economies ,",
"which would both help catalyze a sustained private recovery in these economies , allow for interest rates increases and limit spillovers to emerging economies .",
"Following substantial easing in the first half of 2009 , several emerging economies including in Brazil , Indonesia , and South Africa have paused in their monetary easing cycles on account of inflation concerns",
"Specifically : In Brazil , slowing economic conditions will make it difficult to achieve the original budget targets for 2014",
"There is scope for better cooperation on withdrawal of UMP , especially through wider central bank discussions of exit plans",
"In Japan , the BoJ 's objective to raise inflation to 2 percent and the sweeping enhancements to the monetary framework are welcome",
"If the economy is not at risk of overheating , the appropriate policy response would be to lower interest rates and to tighten fiscal policy , thus reducing currency appreciation pressures",1
"The scale of fiscal adjustment required to ensure fiscal sustainability will be large , particularly in advanced economies",
With the exception of the ECB which cut its refinancing rate further by 25 basis points to one percent in early May,
major advanced country central banks are now effectively at the lower bound for policy rates,
"The crisis compelled central banks to employ a wide range of measures , in many cases unprecedented",
"that the current aggressive pace of monetary easing may need to be maintained for an extended period , providing more information about asset purchases beyond could further enhance transparency",
These monetary measures need to be supplemented by progress on ` third arrow ' structural reforms,
"In general , policy responses should be anchored by sound and credible monetary policy frameworks",
These economies may have to consider tightening their fiscal stance more quickly,
while maintaining measures aimed at mitigating the social impact of the crisis,
"Following a long period of low rates , excessive may have built in some sectors credit booms in a number of smaller advanced economies and the underpricing of risks in certain segments of United States financial markets",
"monetary policy accommodation is thus the right policy from a domestic perspective , considering also",1
that the recovery is expected to remain sluggish going forward,
"These monetary policy efforts should be supported by measures to strengthen bank balance sheets ,",
which would help to improve monetary policy transmission and credit market conditions,
"Building bank capital buffers will help to achieve this by breaking the adverse feedback loop between rising sovereign spreads , deteriorating bank funding , and flagging activity",
Excessive may have built in some sectors credit booms in a number of smaller advanced economies and the underpricing of risks in certain segments of United States financial markets after more than five years of exceptionally low rates,
This will take pressure off monetary and prudential policies and create fiscal space to respond to future shocks,
Macroeconomic policies are most effective,
when deployed within coherent frameworks,
"To benefit most from the additional easing , it should be supported with fiscal , structural , and ambitious incomes policies",
Sustainably lowering inflation will also require further increases in the policy rate and a simpler monetary framework with clear objectives and operational autonomy for the RBI .,
It will be important to have clarity on the process and objectives,
that will guide discussions between the United Kingdom and the E.U,
"Finally , communication should focus on the overarching goal of achieving the inflation target in a stable manner through a more transparent presentation of the BoJ 's forecast and underlying assumptions",
"In case actual or expected inflation stagnate or growth disappoints , the Bank of Japan should act swiftly through further and/or asset purchases",
A strong commitment to fully implement the asset purchase program and adjust the program,
if needed will help meet ECB 's price stability objective,
But this must be accompanied by macro prudential measures and enhanced financial supervision,
where there are risks of overheating in some sectors such as real estate .,
"In many emerging markets , financial market reforms have the potential to assist the effective transmission of monetary policies while allowing for sustainable credit expansions",
"Monetary policy can remain accommodative in the major advanced countries , but monetary tightening may be considered in some emerging economies facing risks of overheating",1
"Hence , plans for fiscal consolidation should generally take priority , all else given",
Some emerging economies should consider prudential actions to limit excessive credit creation,
"Notwithstanding recent rate hikes in some emerging economies , real interest rates remain far below precrisis levels and hence too low",1
that may impede this rebalancing would need to be addressed,
"In the United States , monetary policy should continue to gradually normalize and remain data dependent , and plans for the Fed 's balance sheet should be",1
"Fiscal consolidation should proceed gradually , anchored in credible plans ,",
which are lacking in some countries notably Japan and the United States,
"Also , authorities will need to remain vigilant against the prospect of deteriorating credit quality emerging as a result of the monetary policy easing undertaken so far",
There is a need to put the global financial system on a more resilient footing,
"High unemployment and large output gaps are keeping wages and inflation expectations in the major advanced economies in check , notwithstanding large increases in food and energy prices",
"The government should articulate structural measures to underpin the consolidation path , including subsidy reform and progress on the Goods and Services Tax",
"While monetary policy should continue supporting the recovery , challenges are increasingly different across countries",
"Under some circumstances , reserve accumulation , restrictions on capital inflows and measures could also form part of the policy mix",
"For oil exporters , the need to adjust fiscal stance would depend on the scope of savings from past higher prices of oil and exchange rate regimes",
"More recently however , inflation expectations have reversed , and the euro has strengthened ,",
which could put downward pressure on prices,
"The expected boost in economic activity from lower oil prices has not materialized , and lower energy costs are keeping inflation low",
"Finally , the pace of fiscal withdrawal in 2014 15 is broadly appropriate in Japan , but a consolidation plan remains needed",
"needs to be done in the euro area ,",
"where the growth outlook is very weak , unemployment is high , and inflation is projected well below the 2 percent target",
"Where public debt is elevated , fiscal space should be through consolidation Brazil , India , Mexico",
"In the United States , monetary policy should continue to remain ,",
while downside risks to the outlook confirm the case for a very gradual upward path for the federal funds rate,
"As recent turbulences have shown , economies with deteriorating macroeconomic imbalances , larger external funding requirements relative to reserves and lower policy credibility see more volatility",
"In particular , maintaining accommodative monetary policy through 2011 , including through an expansion of central bank balance sheets , can counteract some of the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation",1
Monetary authorities have instruments to maintain control over interest rate policy,
"However , fiscal policies need to urgently deliver measures",
that lower deficits over the medium-term,
Targeted programs to ease,
credit constraints would be also useful,
where the transmission mechanism is impaired,
"With inflation still elevated , monetary tightening may have to be stepped up",1
should inflation expectations worsen,
"In an environment of ongoing but incomplete transition to financial stability , changing growth dynamics and concerns about slow growth and high unemployment , achieving a better policy mix is important",
"The Fed 's employment and inflation objectives should guide policy decisions and the beginning of normalization of the monetary policy stance ,",
which is currently expected around,
Central banks should be mindful,
"that further declines in inflation , even if temporary , may lead to additional downdraft in inflation expectations and rising real interest rates",
"While net commodity importers benefit from reduced inflation pressures and external vulnerabilities , the scope for monetary policy easing could be limited in a context tighter external financing conditions",
"Large international reserves have provided scope , in some cases , to counter exchange rate volatility and sustain the availability of foreign currency funding , for example for trade finance",
"In the euro area , the ECB 's expanded asset purchase program has improved confidence and financial conditions , and raised inflation expectations initially",
"Given the nature of the turnaround in global activity and financial markets , ",
"the paramount objectives for monetary , fiscal , and financial sector policies are continued support for the recovery , fully restoring the financial sector to health , and limiting downside risks",
"In the euro area , the ECB 's expanded asset purchase program has supported confidence and eased financial conditions , but inflation remains low",
But public capital injections may also be necessary,
"Current projections are for a limited decline in budget deficits of emerging economies in 2011 and 2012 ,",
even though output growth and capacity utilization would continue to be above trend,
"and pursue structural reforms to boost jobs and growth , with the appropriate policy mix depending on their respective circumstances",
"In the United States , the main policy issue is the appropriate timing and pace of monetary policy normalization",1
"Where demand is still lacking , there is scope for macroeconomic policies to help growth while advancing the impact of structural reforms",
"In the meantime , there is some room for a lower policy rate",1
"With prospects improving , it will be critical to avoid a premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation , including in the United States",1
an expansionary fiscal stance has a direct impact,
on the build up of debt,
Joint efforts by deficit and surplus economies to rebalance global demand would reduce excess external imbalances while sustaining growth,
"Moreover , some of these economies are again seeing significant asset price increases and credit growth in response to low interest rates , raising the specter of renewed equity or real estate booms",
Conventional monetary tightening will need to be accompanied by steps to offset the impact of large central bank balance sheets,1
Policymakers should also address structural obstacles to continued high growth while rebuilding fiscal policy buffers,
"In particular : Monetary policy responses , more generally , to external pressures will depend on country conditions and frameworks",
"In countries with credit growth , supervisory and macro prudential measures should be deployed to curb sectoral excesses .",
There is also room to expand the Loan Support Program,
in order to further enhance the monetary policy transmission,
"that there is space , a supportive fiscal stance can help offset adverse effects of structural reforms on aggregate demand , bringing forward the growth benefits",
The breathing space provided by exceptionally accommodative monetary policies should be used by authorities to tackle underlying issues,
that prevent a solid return to growth,
The principles laid out below are intended to establish common ground for the design and implementation of policies during the exit from extraordinary support measures taken during the crisis,
"Nevertheless , there is a concern about diminishing effectiveness of unconventional actions , their side effects for example , volatile capital flows , and potential difficulties related to unwinding them",
Recovery in advanced economies will need readily available credit to allow easy monetary conditions to pass through,
"For example , some labor market reforms benefit employment more",
when demand is already strong,
as this helps,
job seekers find work faster or,
when fiscal and monetary policies can provide support,
"This risk is limited over the near term ,",
as weak balance sheets and confidence are likely to weigh on credit availability,
The three requirements for a more resilient recovery are : sustained but gradual fiscal adjustment,
"Monetary policy should have some leeway to ease in emerging Asia , especially in 2014 ,",1
"as the output gap , core inflation falls , and inflation expectations are well anchored",
"Minimal room remains to lower policy rates in key advanced economies , except the euro area , and monetary transmission may be hindered by the state of the financial sector",1
"In the euro area , more monetary easing",1
"is needed to raise the prospects of achieving the ECB 's inflation objective , including by supporting demand , given the weak and fragile growth , large output gaps and very low inflation",1
There are incipient signs of rising exposure to both interest rate and credit risk in regional banks,
"that require increased vigilance ,",
as low interest rates squeeze interest margins,
These monetary policy efforts should be supported by measures to strengthen bank balance sheets and thereby improve monetary policy transmission and credit market conditions,
"Further action is needed to recapitalize , restructure , or resolve weak banks and improve the flow of credit to the economy , particularly in Europe",
"For countries with less policy space , exchange rate flexibility will be a critical buffer to the shock",
This is advisable considering both the relative scales of policy adjustment required and managing risks to both economic and financial recovery,
"For most countries , the risks presented by keeping stimulus in place too long suggest",
that adjustment is a key priority,
"In Europe , the resolution of loans should be accelerated through a combination of stricter supervision , insolvency reform , and the facilitation of secondary markets in distressed debt",
Monetary policy : maintain accommodation,1
"Cyclical weakening calls for monetary policy easing , or less tightening , for those economies",1
where inflation and expectations are well anchored to provide room for maneuver,
"At the same time , a prolonged period of very low interest rates could fuel excessive risk taking",1
"In the euro area , bank balance sheet repair remain essential to restore confidence and revive credit growth , and policymakers should make further progress on banking union through a Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism , and advance structural reforms",
The United Kingdom faces similar challenges :,
"while monetary policy should stay accommodative for now , it might , however , have to be tightened quickly",1
if costs run ahead of productivity growth or,
"slack is absorbed , or",
Tightening could also be considered,1
if macroprudential tools prove insufficient to deal with financial stability risks with due consideration to the tradeoffs involved the real economy,
"Commercial paper rates are falling in advanced economies , driven in part by major central banks ' direct purchases and liquidity operations targeted at corporate financing",
Buffers should be rebuilt to create space for action,
should downside risks materialize,
"In such economies which include Brazil , India and Turkey there is room for further consolidation",
"In Brazil , the room for monetary policy easing is limited by underlying inflationary pressures and fiscal consolidation should continue to reduce large deficits",1
"Although policy requirements remain paramount ,",
"as signs of an economic turnaround in the global economy become more prevalent , markets have begun to express their concern about the future ramifications of unprecedented policy actions and massive public intervention",
"Greater exchange rate appreciation would dampen inflationary pressures , including from world commodity prices , introduce more risk for capital inflows , and facilitate external rebalancing in surplus economies",
"Fiscal policy should be growth friendly , with the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment",
where needed attuned to supporting the recovery,
"Excessive may be building in some sectors United States corporate credit and insurance markets , housing price booms in a number of smaller advanced economies after more than five years of exceptionally low rates see annex",
"Taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment and depending on the availability of fiscal space , there is a case for more public investment",
and more efforts to better anchor expectations may be required,
where strong nominal anchors are not well established .,
"In Japan , the recent fiscal stimulus makes developing a credible fiscal plan",
that stabilizes and reduces debt even more urgent,
This would allow for monetary policy to be tightened more gradually or by less than otherwise required,1
"National authorities should commit to provide sufficient national backstops ,",
while the establishment of a common backstop ESM direct recapitalization remains crucial to sever links in countries,
where debt dynamics are a concern and fiscal space is limited,
"Central bank purchases of assets , refinancing operations , and other interventions in financial markets are helping to reduce funding costs and strengthen confidence , but there may be worsening tradeoffs , including credit misallocation",
National backstops should be used,
where fiscal space exists,
"In some economies Brazil , India , Turkey , maintaining the course of fiscal consolidation is critical , given large fiscal deficits and high inflation in some cases , and high external borrowing",
that has increased exposure to external funding risks in others,
"Term repo rates have declined in major advanced economies , as a result of both policy rate cuts and central bank operations",
that aided the functioning of repo markets,
"Capital controls can be used in some cases , but they should not substitute for necessary macroeconomic and prudential policies",
"At the same time , economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom should embark on fiscal consolidation",
"In the euro area , improving the effectiveness of monetary policy will require the broad range of policies discussed above to reverse financial fragmentation",
"While advanced economy central banks can likely address short term issues related to policy normalization given their large balance sheets , they should continue to monitor any unintended consequences of their policies on linkages , corporate leverage , financial innovation , international capital flows , and asset price bubbles",1
"Given a fragile recovery , an accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate in advanced economies , but negative spillovers to other economies , in particular emerging economies , need to be closely watched and managed carefully",2
fiscal stimulus longer than needed has obvious and immediate consequences for debt accumulation,
There is evidence,
"that forceful monetary easing , alongside enhanced credit and liquidity support , has helped ease financial stress Figure 3",
"Policy rates in major advanced economies are exceptionally low , and markets expect them to remain low for an extended period",
Sustainably higher and inclusive growth requires more forceful and comprehensive policies,
"Accordingly , unemployment is not forecast to be much higher in 2010 than before the crisis ,",
which suggests that inflation pressures would be less subdued than in the advanced economies,
"Developing clear and effective exit strategies from exceptional policy actions will be central to ensure a smooth return to normal market functioning , to safeguard the sustainability of public finances , and to contain concerns about inflation",
Policymakers must remain alert to overheating risks as well as rising domestic financial vulnerabilities,
"If downside risks to global growth materialize , threatening to slow growth appreciably more than expected , monetary policy should be the first line of defense ,",
although this line has become thin,
"With inflationary expectations well anchored , accommodative monetary policy in major advanced economies remains appropriate for now",1
"Other measures , such as lowering barriers for new firms to enter product and services markets , tend to have immediate demand benefits by raising investment and are , therefore , less dependent on the state of the business cycle",
Central banks should also carefully monitor unintended consequences,
"their policies might have , for instance on linkages , corporate leverage , and financial innovation as well as external spillovers",
"In advanced economies , central banks can afford to maintain low interest rates for an extended period ,",1
as underlying inflation is expected to remain very low,
Policymakers in many emerging economies face a growth slowdown accompanied by a more challenging environment,
"Where required and feasible , more supportive macroeconomic policies can reduce the impact on growth",
"Most emerging economies need to bolster their financial stability frameworks to cope with volatile capital flows , including notably from sharp swings in global risk aversion .",
"First , where fiscal policy directly supports infrastructure investment for example , Germany , ",
"it will raise productivity and the growth potential in the future , enhancing sustainability",
"In this context , the new round of stress test should be transparent , sufficiently stringent , and accompanied by contingent plans for quick recapitalization or resolution of banks to reassure markets",
"In most advanced economies , monetary policy is expected to remain appropriately accommodative ,",
while the pace of normalization in the United States,
"which is reaching full employment should continue to be gradual and , alongside well communicated plans for the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet",
The matter is more pressing in Europe due to sovereign contagion risks,
"Several countries have already cut policy rates in response to the recent weakness in activity for example , India , Korea",
While many emerging market and developing economies,
"are already raising policy rates , real rates still remain low or even negative",
"In some emerging economies , lower oil prices may alleviate inflationary pressures and reduce vulnerabilities",
"Fiscal consolidation should continue , underpinned by comprehensive tax reform and further reductions in subsidies",
Monetary policy needs to remain accommodative,1
"until the recovery is well established , while containing potentially adverse side effects",
"At the same time , the design of fiscal policy should better support",
"the growth potential of the economy , including by enhancing infrastructure investment , provided",
"that infrastructure needs have been identified , there is slack in the economy , monetary policy is accommodative , investment processes are relatively efficient , and ratios are not already high",
"Moving expeditiously to address the legacies of the crisis including bank funding concerns , the resolution of weak banks , and the restructuring of balance sheets for distressed households as well as to alleviate",
regulatory uncertainty will strengthen financial systems and help catalyze rapid growth,
major advanced economy central banks have reduced policy interest rates to close to the zero interest floor,
"In the euro area , robust action and are required on multiple fronts",
"Accordingly , in countries with fiscal room , automatic stabilizers should be allowed to play freely , and",
"where stabilizers are small , temporary support , such as extended unemployment benefits or wage subsidies , could be continued",
"External and financial vulnerabilities have risen , and could be exacerbated",
"if capital flow reversals materialize ,",
"as private sector leverage has increased significantly , and current account positions have deteriorated",
Other helpful measures include adjusting the composition of spending toward public investment and moving the revenue structure toward indirect and other taxes relatively less detrimental to growth,
More coordination is necessary to avoid fragmentation,
Consistent implementation and international cooperation is also critical for a level playing field and reducing fragmentation,
"Building on recent achievements , the authorities should aim for sustained wage inflation , supported by higher public sector and minimum wages , alongside labor market reforms",
that reduce duality,
"The key objective will be to maintain price stability , but",
"where financial stability remains fragile , or key markets are not yet functioning , central banks may need to maintain measures or possibly introduce new targeted ones , even within the context of an overall tightening of the monetary policy stance",
"In the United States , Federal Reserve policy should remain data dependent",
"When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation , demand effects are stronger , and the boost in output can lead to a decline in the ratio",
tools should be the first line of defense against financial stability risks,
"As a result , central banks have also taken a number of unconventional measures , including direct intervention in credit markets",
"Some reforms have more potential to boost demand in the short term , such as those",
that lower barriers for new firms to enter product and services markets,
"Looking forward , the appreciation of exchange rates since the first quarter will help support domestic demand , consistent with broader need to rebalance the global economy towards higher consumption in those economies",
that had accumulated reserves before the financial crisis,
"But it would be critical to repair bank balance sheets to reduce financial fragmentation , improve the monetary transmission mechanism , and allow for a sustained recovery in investment",
Capital inflows may require adjustments to the policy mix,
"If inflows raise macro and concerns , macroeconomic policies for example , adjusting the policy mix , exchange rate appreciation , and some reserve accumulation should be complemented with strengthened prudential measures for example , loan to value ratios , funding composition restrictions",
Some emerging economies should remain watchful of inflationary pressures and should not lower interest rates further,1
The reduction in inflation toward the 4 . percent target by 2017 will require a tight monetary policy stance,
"Moreover , QE should be supported by a more balanced policy mix comprising fiscal support , balance sheet repair , and structural reforms",
"In order to enhance the credibility of the exercise and make it easier to raise private capital , greater clarity is needed on the availability of public backstops as safety nets",
"On October 31 st , the Bank of Japan BoJ expanded its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing QQE framework by accelerating purchases of JGBs and extending their maturity and tripling the purchases of private assets ,",
which should support domestic demand,
"Indeed , policy rates may need to rise",1
"before unconventional monetary policy stimulus is fully withdrawn In particular , to the extent",
"that credit markets remain impaired , monetary tightening may need to be led by a raising of policy rates",
"Vulnerabilities may also be building in the financial sector , with a rapid expansion of agency real estate investment trusts REITs , weakening underwriting standards in the leveraged loan market loans",
"issuance has returned to pre crisis levels , and higher credit and liquidity risks taken by pension funds and insurance companies",
"A more expansionary fiscal stance in Germany would not only allow a increase in public investment and raise potential output ,",
"it would also support external adjustment ,",
while at the same time having positive spillovers to other euro area economies,
where there is still cyclical slack,
"However , if the economy is at risk of overheating and there are inflationary pressures , reducing",
"interest rates is not an attractive policy option ,",
while both political considerations and implementation lags may limit the scope for fiscal consolidation .,
"In particular , to ensure that the transmission mechanism for monetary policy remains effective ,",
efforts should be directed at devising targeted schemes,
that help ease credit constraints on firms and households,
The IMF prepared detailed recommendations along these lines on the occasion of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ' Meetings in July 2016,
Monetary policy has remained highly accommodative in many economies,
"Finally , new policy frameworks compatible with a needed shift in the pattern of global demand would facilitate adjustment to a more sustainable and resilient configuration for global growth in the years ahead .",
"The Federal Reserve , Bank of England , and Bank of Japan should stand ready to continue their deployment of unconventional measures and take further steps",1
if needed,
"However , if low growth persists and monetary policy options are depleted ,",
the flexibility in the current fiscal framework may need to be used to respond in these circumstances,
"Emerging economies need to be nimble in dealing with potentially adverse spillovers from advanced economies , and continue to strengthen macroeconomic policy frameworks",
"This is needed not only to halt and ultimately reverse the large rise in public debt ratios , but also to help create room for policy maneuver to support private demand",
"To safeguard the current growth momentum , the macroeconomic policy mix should be adjusted to changing circumstances",
A combination of structural reforms and more expansionary demand policies in surplus economies can also help reduce global external imbalances,
"Further actions , including structural reforms , and cooperation are needed across the membership to lay the foundations for stronger and more balanced growth",
financial sector restructuring and reform should thus be top priorities,
Provision of guarantees on bank funding and expanded liquidity facilities have helped reduce tail risks,
that the liquidity shock could have triggered cascading insolvencies in the financial sector,
"However , the unbalanced recovery across economies suggests",
"that challenges faced by central banks differ , with communication continuing to play a critical role , given",
"that protracted monetary support has raised financial stability concerns : In the United States , with growth expected to increase above trend in the remainder of 2014 and 2015 , the main policy issue is the appropriate speed of monetary policy normalization",
"While macroeconomic policies are but one determinant of the current account , they have contributed to maintain excess imbalances ,",
which illustrates the benefits of recalibrating the policy mix across both surplus and deficit countries see IMF 2017 External Sector Report,
"It will also make systemic institutions more resilient , help contain asset price and credit dynamics , and cushion",
the consequences of liquidity squeezes if volatility spikes,
"economies , on the other hand , need to implement structural reforms to improve competitiveness ,",
which may include wage moderation in line with productivity growth,
"rate flexibility can usefully cushion the impact of adverse external shocks , provided",
that the effects of currency depreciations on balance sheets and domestic inflation rates are contained,
The three requirements for a more resilient recovery are sustained but gradual adjustment,
"Elsewhere , however , in some other countries",
"where debt levels are relatively low , monetary tightening and exchange rate adjustment would be more appropriate than fiscal tightening .",1
A sound execution of the AQR and stress tests will be a key step toward reducing uncertainty about the health of banks and enabling balance sheet repair,
Room for monetary easing is also more limited,1
"where strong credit expansion continues , or",
where currencies are undervalued,
In some economies that have accumulated substantial savings from past higher prices and have fiscal space can let,
"fiscal deficits increase temporarily and draw on these funds to allow for a more gradual adjustment of public spending for example , Saudi Arabia",
"At the same time , strong prudential oversight and supervision of the financial system is essential to address emerging vulnerabilities in both the bank and financial sector owing to ultra low interest rates",
"Given a path for fiscal policies , monetary policy can be set to achieve a desired level of overall stimulus , tightening",1
as needed to counter inflationary risks and maintain price stability,
"The timing , pace , and sequence of exiting from supportive policies will vary by country , depending on how robust the recovery of private demand as well as financial conditions",
"With multiple interdependent factors holding back growth , policymakers have to work all necessary levers structural policies including to promote financial stability and trade , fiscal policies , and monetary policy",
"In Japan , accelerating structural reforms is critical to boost confidence and contribute to higher domestic demand and favorable dynamics",
"When risk sentiment changes , having stronger macroeconomic fundamentals as well as the policy space and credibility to react have proven to be critical to reduce volatility and negative spillovers see Annex",
"In advanced economies , accommodative monetary policy remains essential",1
"For oil exporters , the optimal policy response to the sharp decline in prices will depend on the buffers accumulated during the years of high oil revenue and exchange rate regimes",
Maintaining unconventional,
monetary policy measures does not necessarily constrain increases in policy rates,1
"This task requires a faster recognition of assets , stronger bank capital buffers , and better corporate debt restructuring mechanisms",
Policies need to accelerate the rebalancing of demand from public to private sources in advanced economies and from external deficit to surplus economies,
"In this context , the Bank of Japan should stand ready for further easing",1
"However , reserve stockpiles have been reduced , leaving less room for maneuver",
Appropriate sequencing is important for an orderly withdrawal,
Reinforcing the growth momentum requires the right mix of demand support and supply reforms,
"This would help reduce the burden on monetary and fiscal policy to support the recovery , and minimize the real consequences of deleveraging",
"Though there has been progress on banking system repair , the pace is too slow",
"Policy requirements differ vastly among emerging economies , but many can afford to stay on hold or ease",
if downside risks materialize given the receding inflation pressures,
"From an external perspective , however , there is concern",
that quantitative easing in the United States could result in a flood of capital,
These economies should also consider greater emphasis on fiscal tightening .,
an expansionary fiscal stance has a clear and direct impact on the of debt,
The boost to demand from lower oil prices is thus welcome,
"More policy ambition and cooperation are needed to achieve the 's shared objectives of strong , sustainable , and balanced growth",
"The ECB 's monetary policy should be highly accommodative , consistent with its mandate of ensuring price stability",1
"To avoid the risk of a hard landing and lower their exposure to capital flow reversals ,",
emerging economies should rebuild policy buffers,
The Fed has signaled,
"that interest rates are likely to remain low for an extended period ,",
while other major central banks have indicated,
that monetary policy would only be tightened once the macroeconomic environment improves and the outlook for inflation picks up,1
"Importantly , the type , scale , and timing of adjustment should not be the same , but depend on each country 's own circumstances , or efforts may become",
"an accommodative monetary policy stance ,",
"which can be reversed quickly , has few obvious direct downsides",
"Second , additional demand support from fiscal policies",
"where output gaps are negative can accelerate the benefits of certain structural reforms , such as measures",
"that raise labor supply ,",
which are particularly relevant for European members but also several emerging economies see next section,
Fears of high inflation appear overstated central banks have the tools needed to mop up liquidity and tighten their policy stance,
should inflation expectations unexpectedly rise,
Financial stability risks related to a prolonged period of low interest rates bring macro prudential policies to the forefront,
"Authorities should aim to protect the poor and vulnerable groups through targeted social safety nets , but avoid policies",
"that seek to insulate domestic markets from high world prices for example , export bans or subsidies ,",
which dampens the supply response and amplifies global price volatility,
"At a global level , there is a pressing need",
to complete and implement the regulatory reform agenda,
"In the United States , the main policy question is the appropriate timing and pace of monetary policy normalization",
Repair and reform of financial systems critical to the normalization of credit conditions in several countries and to prevent contagion needs to be accelerated,
Policymakers in Brazil should begin unwinding monetary stimulus,
as the recovery proceeds to ensure,
inflation expectations remain well anchored,
"Importantly , countries that do implement strong recapitalization programs should not be left to fall into a downward spiral for lack of adequate external support",
"For these measures to succeed , they need to be supported by growth and fiscal reforms",
The Fund 's financial stress indices for the major advanced economies have all,
"declined sharply , with some falling below levels ,",
although they remain significantly elevated relative to levels prior to the crisis,
"Accommodative monetary policies remain essential in many advanced economies , given still sizable output gaps and low inflation",1
"More specifically : In India , while external vulnerabilities have moderated and inflation has fallen faster than expected , persistently high inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key macroeconomic challenges",
financial sector restructuring and reform should thus be top priorities,
"Given the deterioration in the inflation and economic outlook and risks of stagnation , the need for a comprehensive strategy to boost growth is particularly relevant in the euro area and Japan",
"In a number of countries , it may be appropriate to devote fiscal resources to reduce private sector debt overhangs and repair financial sector balance sheets",
Raising both actual and potential output through a combination of demand support and structural reforms remains a key policy objective,
"This could be achieved by lower ECB monetary policy interest rates ,",
"for which room exists , and ,",
"as needed , further unconventional measures",
"Large negative growth surprises in euro area countries should not trigger additional consolidation efforts ,",
which would be self-defeating,
A number of emerging market economies are already operating at or above capacity,
The reform agenda is unfinished and needs to be reinvigorated to strengthen the global financial system,
Private debt and financial vulnerabilities require attention,
advanced economies with large surpluses should prioritize structural reforms in labor and product markets,
that would bolster domestic demand,
Some emerging economies can afford to maintain current monetary policy settings or ease,1
"if downside risks materialize ,",
while others may have to take measures to gradually tighten financial conditions,1
"In some for example India , the magnitude of fiscal problems requires an overhaul of tax and subsidy policies .",
"Additional unconventional monetary support targeted long term refinancing operations , lower collateral haircuts could also help reduce fragmentation and restore monetary transmission",1
Emerging economies face both and challenges to support growth,
"In the United States , lower oil prices contribute positively to the recovery and there is a strong case to abstract from the effects of temporary oil supply shocks",
unless they translate into second round effects in wage and price settings for example a persistent decline in longer term inflation expectations,
"In contrast , monetary policy in the euro area and Japan is expected to remain more accommodative for an extended period",
as they fight low inflation euro area or try to persistently raise inflation and inflation expectations Japan,
"In many emerging market economies , macroeconomic policy space",
"to support growth remains limited , but lower",
"oil prices will alleviate inflationary pressures , allowing for a more gradual tightening of monetary policy",1
"Hence , on balance fiscal consolidation should generally take priority , all else given",
Deploying tools to limit financial risks,
which in some cases may require changes to regulatory and legal structures,
can reduce the need for monetary policy response to financial stability concerns,
"Credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks , alongside exchange rate flexibility are needed to weather the turbulence",
"In the euro area , the overall fiscal stance planned for 2014 is neutral ,",
"although a number of countries are still tightening ,",
even if at a slower pace,
"In many advanced economies , monetary policy can afford to remain accommodative for an extended period , given subdued price pressures",
"Moreover , where credit intermediation remains impaired ,",
central banks should continue to explore unconventional measures to stimulate economic activity and improve credit flows,1
"In emerging economies , cyclical positions and vulnerabilities vary across countries , with some facing more intense market pressures ,",
and policy responses will need to be country specific,
and exits in emerging economies with excessive current account surpluses should be accompanied by exchange rate appreciation,
"In economies where recovery is already well established ,",
policymakers will need to pay increasing attention to building inflationary pressure,
"With monetary policy set to remain appropriately supportive , this will be helped by the recommended use of fiscal space for example , to raise potential growth or reduce output gaps in excess surplus economies such as Germany and Korea and gradual fiscal consolidation in excess deficit countries United Kingdom , United States",
"In the United States , following the increase of the federal funds rate in , further actions should be and based on clear evidence of wage or price pressures and an assessment",
that inflation is set to rise steadily toward the Federal Reserve 's two percent objective,
"Widespread financial , fiscal , and structural impediments need to be addressed to bolster growth and financial stability",
Interest rates will need to be raised,1
"as economies recover and output gaps are reduced , but the path should take account of the withdrawal of fiscal support",
"Where inflationary pressures are diminishing and fiscal fundamentals are weak , monetary policy can be eased",1
"This should be anchored by credible plans for debt reduction notably , for the United States and Japan",
Considerable uncertainty remains about the commitment of the government to put in place the complete package of policies required for a successful outcome,
Sovereigns under stress need to continue to adjust and request appropriate EFSF/ESM support,
if needed,
"The recent pause in monetary policy easing has been appropriate given the risks to inflation from ruble depreciation , external risks , and the need to build credibility under the newly introduced inflation targeting regime .",1
The strengthening of the recovery and unwinding of accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies will lead to tighter external financing conditions and could generate further bouts of volatility in capital flows,
"In the near term , priorities include : weathering the current turbulence and capital outflows and choosing policy to close output gaps where possible , or the unavoidable policies for those lacking policy space/credibility",
The right policies will also help to reduce external imbalances,
"This requires slowing credit expansion and switching from investment to more , measures",
"It will also make systemic institutions more resilient , help contain asset price and credit dynamics , and cushion",
the consequences of liquidity squeezes if volatility spikes,
"Meanwhile , the ECB 's commitment to act on secondary markets via the OMT is critical to address elevated risk premia due to convertibility concerns within the euro area ,",
while maintaining a very accommodative monetary policy should support demand,
"In Latin America , economies are operating close to speed limit ,",
which restricts available policy room,
"The scope to do so will require credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks ,",
which has proven essential in coping with volatile financial conditions in the past,
"In advanced economies , macroeconomic policies should support growth",
Government budgetary policies are in the process of moving from stimulus to consolidation,
"In the euro area , policies should support individual countries ' efforts to repair public and private balance sheets and implement structural reforms to restore competitiveness",
"Current plans to end tapering later this year and increase policy rates from the middle of next year appear appropriate , given the sizable slack",1
"Tighten monetary policy and , notably in key surplus economies ,",
allow for greater exchange rate flexibility,
Conventional monetary policy should be eased further,1
Fiscal reforms that have effects but,
that do not affect the economic recovery in the such as entitlement reforms should thus be implemented soon to enhance credibility,
"At the same time , the design of fiscal policy should support growth , including by enhancing infrastructure investment see Annex",
"where needs have been identified , there is slack in the economy , and investment processes are relatively efficient for example , Germany and the United States",
"The situation is more varied across emerging economies , but monetary",
accommodation will likely need to be withdrawn sooner,
"Sharp declines in food and fuel prices have provided the room for central banks in many of these economies to lower interest rates , and they have been appropriately cautious",
in order to avoid disorderly exchange rate moves or triggering capital outflows,
"The recent additional monetary easing is welcome , and further progress is needed in addressing structural weaknesses and improving the quality of fiscal adjustment",
"Moreover , if deflation risks materialize and monetary policy options are depleted , the escape clauses in the fiscal framework may need to be used to respond in these circumstances",
"To secure a strong and durable recovery , policies need a decisive upgrade",
The timing of the policy rate increase should be attuned to inflation and labor market developments,1
"In economies where adjustment is unavoidable ,",
"allowing exchange rate depreciation will be a critical buffer to cushion the impact of the shock for example , Russia ,",
"which highlights the challenges faced by oil exporters with fixed exchange rate regimes for example , Venezuela , Ecuador",
"Reversing financial fragmentation for example , reducing financial home bias , improving bank flows",
To balance inflation concerns particularly in conjunction with the large increase in government indebtedness and central bank balance sheets and the risk,
that liquidity is prematurely withdrawn,
"while the nascent recovery is still fragile , monetary authorities will need to communicate clearly the objectives and the tools of their unconventional policies , as well as their exit strategies",
Room for monetary easing may also be limited,1
where a strong credit expansion continues or,
where currencies are undervalued,
"In Japan , incomes policies and structural reforms",
that raise productivity are vital to tackle risks coming from continuing lackluster growth and the overburdening of monetary policy,
"Monetary policy tightening may encourage these flows ,",1
which will boost credit and thus reduce its effectiveness,
"Notably , raising actual and potential growth remains a key objective",
"Major central banks have acted aggressively , easing policy rates to near zero and using their balance sheets to directly support intermediation",
"said , forceful monetary easing , including unconventional measures , large scale provision of liquidity , and the support for and resolution of systemically important institutions have reduced extreme stress in financial conditions",
that prevailed in Figure 3,
"the most important risk from this policy stance in the current low inflationary environment is the potential for liquidity spillovers , particularly to domestic asset markets and emerging economies",
"Where necessary , fiscal consolidation should remain and support policies",
"that foster innovation and productivity , while protecting the most vulnerable",
Key elements are Monetary,
policy in the major advanced economies should remain accommodative,
Supporting growth and creating jobs is the main challenge in the major advanced economies,
"In advanced economies ,",
"while exceptional monetary accommodation , including through UMP , continues to provide important support to the recovery , potential side effects should be monitored closely and addressed",
as needed,
"Advanced economies should maintain supportive policies , given still substantial output gaps and inflation",
"Nevertheless , working towards meeting the official primary surplus target with sustainable policies",
while continuing to wind down policy lending is important to put gross public debt on a firmly downward path and boost market confidence,
"Even as vulnerabilities are addressed , emerging economies",
can continue to be a strong locomotive of global economic and trade growth through structural reforms,
that provide demand support,
"In economies with broadly balanced external positions , monetary tightening may be complicated ,",
as it could amplify exchange rate pressures,
"The Fed 's policy should thus remain accommodative , including through its UMP ,",1
as benefits still outweigh the costs,
"Where inflation targeting frameworks are already established , improving the transparency of instruments and policy objectives can provide further assurance",
that contractionary shocks will be absorbed .,
"Notwithstanding conceptual difficulties in gauging effectiveness ,",
"central bank actions as well as public interventions have improved the functioning of money , foreign exchange , and commercial paper markets",
and support,
for them and their banks provided via the ESM would relieve funding pressures and break the adverse feedback loops between sovereigns and banks,
"Exchange rate flexibility , alongside credible macroeconomic policies and frameworks , has also proven to be an essential tool in coping with volatile capital flows",
Monetary policy frameworks will also need to pay renewed attention to the role of asset prices and financial stability in the pursuit of their core mandates,
"As some start exiting UMP , communication and cooperation will be key to avoid or manage bouts of financial market volatility",
and more confidence in policymakers ' ability to act decisively,
"Accommodative monetary policies remain essential in many advanced economies , given still sizable output gaps",1
"Current differences in monetary policy conditions could give rise to larger capital inflows to emerging market countries , accentuating the need for policies to encourage rebalancing the global sources of demand",
"Achieving fiscal sustainability will be a difficult and prolonged process , making it imperative for consolidation to begin as soon",
as there is clear evidence of recovery,
Where fiscal space is a constraint for example because of particularly high levels of public debt or other concerns,
consolidation efforts should be gradual and as as possible,
"While approaches have differed , major central banks have acted effectively to support economic activity and credit creation",
"China should build on recent efforts to address financial vulnerabilities by continuing regulatory/supervisory tightening , greater recognition of bad assets , more credit allocation , and gradually reducing monetary policy accommodation",1
if core inflation picks up,
Requirements differ across countries,
"An early agreement on credible deficit reduction would provide the space to fund investments in infrastructure , to raise productivity and innovation , and enhance workers ' skills",
"In Japan , further monetary easing may also be needed to reach the 1 percent inflation goal",1
The pace of recapitalization needs to be accelerated in order to provide cushions against asset losses or shocks to liquidity,
"In the United States , monetary policy normalization should continue to be gradual and data driven",1
"In those economies with broadly balanced external positions , monetary tightening may be complicated",1
as it could attract capital inflows,
that undermine competitiveness,
"In many advanced economies , the financial sector remains the Achilles heel of recovery prospects for private demand",
"To forestall this adverse circuit , the ECB 's monetary policy should be highly accommodative , consistent with its mandate of ensuring price stability",1
"Emerging economies face starkly diverse cyclical positions , but the emphasis should generally be on enhancing resilience",
as discussed below,
"In Japan , monetary policy has helped lift inflation and inflation expectations",
"In emerging Europe , the scope for monetary easing has been limited by the risk of exacerbating capital outflows",
"The Federal Reserve , Bank of England , and Bank of Japan should stand ready to continue or expand their deployment of unconventional measures ,",1
if needed,
"Central banks have been at the forefront of the policy response to the recent global slowdown , and should continue supporting the recovery ,",
"while managing risks to price stability In advanced economies , monetary policy should remain very accommodative and central banks should stand ready to do more if needed",1
"As the priority in major advanced economies is to put in place sound fiscal programs , tightening monetary policies prematurely ,",
"as fiscal support is phased out , could undercut global recovery",
The unbalanced recovery across economies suggests,
"that low inflation would pose challenges to central banks , although to a different degree",
Comprehensive and ambitious consolidation plans and entitlement reform are instrumental given tradeoffs facing fiscal policy,
"In emerging market economies , solid policy frameworks will be crucial",
"Where inflation is still well below targets , monetary policy should remain expansionary , using all available instruments for example , in Japan and the euro area",1
"With nominal policy rates still at or close to the zero lower bound in many economies , monetary policy must remain accommodative , including through unconventional measures , to reduce risks to activity from low inflation and prolonged weak demand",1
Further advancing the process of financial restructuring and balance sheet repair including bank recapitalization remains a priority to achieve a healthy financial system,
"Forceful fiscal and monetary stimulus and financial sector support have helped ease financial stress and played an important role in supporting activity , but may need to be maintained for some time",
"One such option could be a longer term LTRO combined with a review of current collateral policies , particularly on loans to SMEs",
"Economies with external surpluses should provide room for monetary tightening by allowing currencies to appreciate ,",
while economies with external deficits may need to consider tightening macroprudential measures or using capital flow management measures in conjunction with monetary tightening,
Some will have to strengthen their monetary frameworks to avert the possibility,
"that depreciation will lead to persistently higher inflation and further depreciation , and to adapt to the prospects of a protracted deterioration in terms of trade",
"Importantly , not all countries should adjust in the same way , to the same extent , or at the same time ,",
lest their efforts become self-defeating,
"An effective monetary policy communication strategy will remain essential , particularly in an environment of higher financial market volatility",
"Reestablishing confidence and resolving the current crisis requires a cohesive , comprehensive , and cooperative package of policies across the",
"However , imbalances based on current policy trajectories are projected to widen again , signaling the need for further underlying adjustment",
"In a majority of advanced countries , output gaps remain negative , weak labor markets threaten to permanently scar especially the young in the workforce , and inflation is low and far off target",
"In countries facing growth and inflation , macroeconomic policies will have to weigh possible",
"A heavy reliance on unconventional monetary policy UMP , for example , has had overall positive effects and has bought time but needs support from other policies to succeed",
"In all but the most vulnerable countries , automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully and ,",
"where stabilizers are small , temporary support such as extended unemployment benefits or wage subsidies",
could be continued,
The effectiveness of the easing in Japan would be enhanced by broadening asset purchases to include more equities and corporate bonds and government bonds with longer maturities and by simultaneously adopting broad structural and fiscal reforms to achieve a sustained recovery,
Progress on fiscal reform would also help quell concerns about political pressure on central banks to keep interest rates too low longer,
"than warranted , given the massive purchases by various central banks of government paper since 2008",
"In the euro area , policymakers should work together to demonstrate their continuing commitment to the E.U",
"Monetary policy can respond more quickly to achieve the desired level of overall stimulus ,",
when fiscal retrenchment begins,
"that eliminate distortions to domestic demand in key emerging economies would strengthen prospects for external demand rebalancing , supporting a more robust recovery in both emerging and advanced economies",
"Monetary policy can remain accommodative in the major advanced countries , but central banks need to prepare and clearly communicate credible strategies for unwinding the extraordinary monetary policy support",1
"The scale of fiscal adjustment required is large to ensure debt sustainability and to restore room for policy maneuver , particularly in advanced economies",
"Vulnerabilities are currently masked by unusually accommodative monetary conditions , but the window of opportunity to prepare the financial system against potential systemic shocks could close unexpectedly",
Monetary Policy : Accommodative in Advanced Economies,
"Given excess capacity , recent signs",
"that growth has slowed , and planned fiscal consolidation , current monetary policy accommodation should remain as long",
as inflation expectations remain,
Efforts to increase revenue mobilization and improve expenditure prioritization should continue,
Policy priorities are thus for a coherent macroeconomic policy mix with a credible nominal anchor and good communication,
"An effective response requires strengthening supervision and frameworks , as well as addressing corporate and banking sector vulnerabilities",
Reducing uncertainties surrounding `` Brexit '' would help reduce the risk of a protracted tightening of financial conditions,
"If needed to support demand , fiscal policy provided space",
is available may be the appropriate tool in such cases .,
Monetary policy should continue supporting demand given the output gaps and ongoing fiscal consolidation,
reducing credit spreads in the periphery is essential to improve the transmission of monetary policy as well as foster sustainable growth,
There is scope for lower ECB policy rates,
"If downside risks materialize , the Federal Reserve , Bank of England , and Bank of Japan should stand ready to expand unconventional support",1
Clear communication of central bank intentions is vital to help avoid new financial excesses or abrupt reversals of capital flows,
"To tackle structural imbalances , advanced",
"economies should implement policies to reduce barriers to foreign competition and domestic investments in certain sectors , especially services , and to increase labor force participation of the elderly",
"In Brazil , policymakers should stand ready to start unwinding monetary stimulus",1
as the recovery proceeds,
in order to securely anchor inflation expectations,
"In particular , a Single Resolution Mechanism SRM based on an independent centralized authority , with efficient resolution powers supported by a single resolution fund would be necessary to ensure least cost and timely resolution",
"With output gaps still large , and inflation running below target , accommodative monetary conditions remain essential for advanced economies , including in the United States , to avoid cyclical impediments to growth from becoming structural",1
"For most countries , fiscal consolidation should be a top priority , with monetary policy able to adjust more flexibly to achieve a desired level of overall stimulus",
"In China , the monetary expansion has quickly fed through to the domestic economy and there may be a need to tighten credit conditions in the face of sharply rising credit growth and the potential for overinvestment",1
The challenges of placing fiscal policy on a sustainable path both political and economic are greater than for normalizing monetary policy,
"In the United States , further repair of household balance sheets is needed , as middle income households ,",
"who were hurt severely by the housing bust , have made limited progress in repairing their balance sheets",
This strikes the right balance between demand support and debt reduction,
Those commodity exporters,
that still have fiscal buffers should use them to smooth the adjustment to lower commodity prices,
"Thus , policy tightening will have to continue",
External rebalancing should continue,
"Global imbalances have narrowed sharply after the crisis , reflecting some painful corrections and cyclical factors see chart",
"There monetary policy tightening is needed , along with greater exchange rate flexibility and the use of macroprudential tools",1
Monetary policies in other advanced economies should remain highly accommodative,1
"Nonetheless , some economies for example , Turkey",
that rely heavily on private external financing will need to proactively further adjust policies,
Japan 's newly announced easing measures to achieve a new 2 percent inflation target within 2 years are welcome,
but they need to be accompanied by ambitious growth and fiscal strategies to reduce risks and ensure sustained recovery,
that benefits Japan and other economies,
"Indeed , a strategy of deploying all available tools can counter damaging perceptions",
that the policy space to use individual instruments might be limited,
Countries should continue to rebuild monetary and fiscal policy space,
where it is limited considering possible tradeoffs between building buffers and slowing growth and strengthen policy frameworks,
where their credibility has come into question,
The monetary policy stance needs to remain tight to ensure a durable reduction in inflation and inflation expectations,1
A quicker transition period for the mutualization of national contributions to the single resolution fund and a clearer decision on a common backstop and its timing are required to adequately break links,
Structural reforms are needed to raise potential output in both advanced and emerging economies,
Financial policies need to secure stability and support recovery,
"With shrinking fiscal buffers , many commodity exporters need to develop new growth models and tackle fiscal adjustment , including through reduced but more efficient public expenditures , stronger fiscal frameworks , and mobilizing new sources of revenues",
"Given falling confidence and activity as well as inflation expectations , monetary policy in advanced economies should remain very accommodative",1
This can be achieved,
even while central banks begin to withdraw the emergency support provided to banks and financial markets,
"There is increasing divergence in the monetary policy stances between advanced and emerging economies , reflecting macroeconomic developments ,",
while financial sector support has been extended in some European countries,
"In the United States , while the recent bipartisan fiscal agreements was an important positive step , ",
further fiscal efforts are needed to stabilize the ratio in the,
as interest rates gradually increase and the demographic transition intensifies,
Fiscal positions should generally aim at rebuilding policy space,
"In countries where fiscal adjustment is needed to avoid destabilizing debt dynamics and rebuild policy buffers , ",
"consolidation is appropriate and should be supported by measures for example , in Italy",
fiscal policy should ensure,
"that the ratio of debt to GDP is on a downward path , while supporting the potential of the economy",
"In India , more efforts are needed to continue reducing stubbornly high inflation and the large fiscal deficit",
Policymakers should stand ready to act more aggressively,
should the impact of financial market turbulence and higher uncertainty threaten to materially weaken the global outlook,
which in some cases may require changes to regulatory and legal structures is essential to limit financial risks and reduce the risk of monetary policy tightening not warranted by the cyclical position,
"Specifically : In the United States , the main challenge is to reach the appropriate speed of monetary policy normalization ,",1
which is made difficult by uncertainties about the cyclical position and monetary transmission,
"This includes paying interest on excess reserves ,",
even while central bank balance sheets continue to provide support to some markets .,
"In the United Kingdom , still accommodative monetary policy has been combined with macro prudential tools to contain financial stability risks",
"There is scope for better cooperation on unwinding UMP , especially through wider central bank discussions of exit plans",
"The government should pursue fiscal consolidation by addressing rigidities and unsustainable mandates on the spending side , including in the social security system , and through tax measures and discretionary spending cuts to bolster fiscal results in the short run",
"In some emerging economies for example , Brazil , emerging Asia , owing to rapidly closing output gaps or concerns about credit quality , monetary accommodation is already being removed or will need be to be removed relatively soon",1
"Insufficient progress with repair and reform is weighing on credit , and slowing the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies , with adverse spillovers on emerging economies",
Monetary policy tightening may also be necessary,1
should inflation expectations worsen .,
Prospects for an uneven recovery points to an asynchronous unwinding of monetary stimulus in advanced economies,
"Monetary policy must remain the first line of defense ,",
although this line is becoming increasingly thin in most advanced economies,
"In sequencing an exit from policies , fiscal policy should generally take priority",
Collective efforts to enhance the global safety net and strengthen the resilience of the International Monetary System IMS should be renewed,
The appropriate course for policy to balance fostering growth and managing vulnerabilities will be,
"Brazil continues to face a considerable inflation challenge , with inflation exceeding the upper limit of the inflation target band ,",
which requires further monetary tightening,1
A number of distortions keep saving high in key surplus countries,
Central banks will need to devise plans to exit from unconventional measures to ensure a smooth return to private intermediation and to forestall concerns,
that inflation could rise rapidly,
"A number of these economies , notably in Asia , are already enjoying relatively vigorous rebounds of activity",
"With fiscal stimulus gradually receding , a premature tightening of monetary policy could undercut the recovery",1
Monetary authorities need to prevent such rises from generating successive increases,
Collective effort is also required to further enhance global safety nets and strengthen the International Monetary System,
banking system stability is also a priority,
"Hence , the program should be extended",
if there is not sufficient improvement in inflation consistent with meeting price stability objectives,
Monetary and fiscal policies can help to reduce inflows,
"if the central bank has exhausted the sterilization possibilities and risks losing monetary control , or does not want to accumulate further reserves assuming",
that further exchange rate appreciation would not be appropriate,
This will require making tangible progress toward a genuine economic monetary union starting with a banking union with greater fiscal integration,
"ample liquidity and easy monetary policy , mainly in advanced economies",
"Accommodative monetary policies should be accompanied by efforts to strengthen balance sheets and credit supply , and by active macroprudential measures",
that address financial stability risks,
"For some countries , using fiscal policy to contain",
demand pressures may be preferable,
if tighter monetary conditions risk exacerbating pressures from capital inflows,
"Thus , the first challenge is",
when to raise interest rates and the second is,
how to withdraw excess liquidity,
"In countries where fiscal adjustment is needed ,",
"consolidation should be gradual and as as possible ,",
while structural reforms should prioritize measures,
that could have a beneficial impact on public finances over the,
This would help pass through of monetary accommodation,
"In the euro area , restoring the transmission channel requires addressing counterparty risk in the interbank market and the redenomination risk",
Dealing with commodity price rises poses a particular challenge,
"In emerging economies , managing vulnerabilities and rebuilding resilience are high priorities in a context of tightening external financial conditions",
"A successful resolution of the current crisis will thus require a cohesive , comprehensive , and cooperative package of policies across the",
"More generally , where monetary policy is constrained , as in individual euro area members ,",
fiscal and structural policies,
to facilitate relative price adjustments should take priority .,
"Further actions could include longer term LTROs possibly targeted to SMEs , and further rate cuts , including mildly negative deposit rates , to support demand and reduce fragmentation",
"Along with addressing sovereign tensions , removing uncertainty about the resilience of banks",
is the top priority for the euro area,
"Also , a tightening of the fiscal stance may help monetary and debt management ,",
while a monetary tightening will contribute to a worsening of the fiscal position,
"In Brazil , an appropriate macroeconomic policy mix and restored",
policy frameworks are imperative for a turnaround in confidence and investment,
once major political uncertainties are resolved,
The overall pace of policy adjustment and removal of financial support will depend on the strength of recovery in private demand in each country and enduring financial stability,
Monetary policy stances are generally aligned with IMF recommendations,
In response to negative growth surprises in the euro area flexibility within the fiscal governance framework could and should be used,
where possible to avoid triggering additional consolidation efforts,
"To unwind policies in an orderly manner and reassure markets , policy makers will need to develop and communicate",
"plans that achieve timely and smooth exits for extraordinary monetary , fiscal , and financial sector interventions , while being careful to avoid a premature withdrawal of support",
that could set back the healing process and the incipient recovery,
"The Federal Open Market Committee 's FOMC decision should remain , with the first increase in the federal funds rate waiting",
until continued strength in the labor market is accompanied by firm signs of inflation rising steadily toward the Federal Reserve 's 2 percent inflation objective,
Monetary policy in emerging economies has to balance the need to support demand against the risk of exacerbating capital outflows or deteriorating credit quality,
"Where monetary policy operates near or at the lower bound , fiscal policy has an important role to play",
Stricter regulation of nonperforming loans and measures to improve insolvency and foreclosure procedures are a priority in this regard,
Vulnerabilities in corporate financial positions and public bank asset quality could threaten financial stability,
if left unaddressed,
The strategy for fiscal consolidation should be outlined and communicated now,
"In contrast , where inflation is still below central bank targets and output gaps remain negative , monetary policy should stay supportive Japan , euro area and available",1
fiscal space should be used actively to provide further additional support,
"Strengthening transparency , especially in communicating policy objectives and enhancing data quality , will be key to minimize spillovers and financial volatility",
"An effective monetary policy communication strategy will remain essential , also in light of differences between market and FOMC expectations about the path of interest rates",
"Where monetary policy is becoming over burdened , domestic policy coordination can help to make macroeconomic support effective",
Financial sector reforms also need to be urgently completed,
One of the key lessons from experiences of similar crises is,
"that withdrawing policy stimulus too early can be very costly ,",
particularly if the financial system remains vulnerable and prone to adverse shocks,
"In emerging economies , monetary policy may need to respond more sensitively to inflation shocks from higher commodity prices due to higher mainly for food prices , less so for energy , less inflation expectations , and economies",1
"that are operating closer to , or above , capacity .",
"While the recent cabinet decision on the fiscal and growth strategies is welcome , more concrete and decisive",
measures should be formulated in the near future,
Stricter treatment of nonperforming loans and measures to improve insolvency and foreclosure procedures are a priority in this regard,
"The unwinding of medium and asset purchases is likely to be more gradual , and new instruments may be required to liquidity in a manner",
that balances the risks to economic growth and price stability,
"This suggests that the timing of exits will be country specific ,",
although coordination on some specific fronts is desirable,
and the monetary union,
including by agreeing on a common policy response to the refugee surge and securing external borders,
"In Japan , the recently announced additional fiscal stimulus is set to boost demand along with expansionary monetary policy , but it also provides an opportunity to accelerate the impact of structural reforms , in particular in the labor market",
"The Federal Open Market Committee 's FOMC decision should remain and with little evidence of meaningful wage and price pressures so far ,",
the normalization is expected to be gradual,
Priority should be given to fiscal consolidation particularly in countries,
"where current account deficits are widening , with monetary policy remaining the first line of defense",
"Addressing corporate and bank vulnerabilities is a priority in many countries , including in several emerging economies and the euro area ,",
where the structural overcapacity of the financial sector elevates operation costs and reduces profitability,
The focus of macroeconomic policies should remain on addressing vulnerabilities and rebuilding policy buffers,
"Foreign exchange swap and forward markets have also improved , as a result of the Fed 's Term Auction Facility TAF , central bank currency swap arrangements , and effectively unlimited funding from the ECB up to 1 year",
which has reduced European bank demand for dollar funding,
"The policy response would be to lower interest rates , thus reducing incentives for inflows , and to tighten fiscal policy particularly",1
when capital inflows are driven by fiscal expansion thus reducing currency appreciation pressures,
"Finally , lack of credibility , notably where inflation is above target , complicates the monetary policy response",
as exchange rate depreciation could feed into inflation expectations and lead to a worsening inflation outlook .,
"In many emerging economies , macroeconomic policy space to support growth is more limited ,",
"with inflation still above target in some economies , and fiscal positions weaker than desirable in others",
"To summarize , responding to an unprecedented global crisis and its aftermath will require coherent and determined policy actions , orderly exits , and new frameworks to address the challenges facing the global economy",
"By contrast , most emerging economies are projected to maintain neutral or somewhat contractionary monetary stances , suitably contributing to bring or keep inflation in line with central bank targets",
