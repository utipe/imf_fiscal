Policy priorities have taken on more urgency compared to the February G-20 Surveillance Note. Notably, raising actual and potential growth remains a key objective. In advanced economies, accommodative monetary policy remains essential. Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, including through increased infrastructure investment. In many emerging economies, macroeconomic policy space to support growth is more limited, with inflation still above target in some economies, and fiscal positions weaker than desirable in others. Structural reforms are needed to raise potential output in both advanced and emerging economies. Joint efforts by deficit and surplus economies to rebalance global demand would reduce excess external imbalances while sustaining growth. Fiscal policy should be growth friendly. Managing high public debt in a low-growth and low-inflation environment remains a key challenge in many economies. Fiscal consolidation should remain growth friendly and be anchored in credible medium-term plans. In the United States, the priority remains to agree on a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, including higher tax revenue. In the euro area, countries should adhere to their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), but those with fiscal space, notably Germany, could do more to encourage growth, especially by undertaking much-needed public infrastructure investment and supporting structural reforms. Growth-friendly fiscal rebalancing could include lower marginal taxes on labor and capital financed by cuts to unproductive spending or base-broadening measures. In Japan, a credible medium-term strategy for fiscal adjustment with specific measures is urgently needed, given high public debt ratios.
