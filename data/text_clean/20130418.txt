Fiscal tightening must continue at a pace that preserves the recovery. Policy makers must aim to nurture short-term recovery and have credible medium-term adjustment plans to help anchor expectations and gain flexibility. Short-term adjustment must be calibrated appropriately. However, some advanced economies where private demand has been chronically disappointing should consider smoothing the pace of consolidation, if they have the room for maneuver. In the United Kingdom, for example, greater flexibility in the pace of near-term fiscal consolidation should be considered given the weak recovery owing to lackluster demand. More generally, if growth surprises on the upside policymakers should reduce headline deficits faster, aiming for fiscal balances in cyclically-adjusted or structural terms. Comprehensive and ambitious consolidation plans and entitlement reform are instrumental given tradeoffs facing fiscal policy. In the United States, agreement on a credible fiscal roadmap could help create some short-term policy space, mitigate risks of excessive near-term consolidation, and ease the burden currently placed on monetary policy. In Japan, the recent fiscal stimulus makes developing a credible fiscal plan that stabilizes and reduces debt even more urgent. Progress on medium-term fiscal reform would also help quell concerns about political pressure on central banks to keep interest rates too low longer than warranted, given the massive purchases by various central banks of government paper since 2008. It will create greater scope to pursue supportive monetary policy without triggering concern about central bank independence or a resurgence of inflation.
