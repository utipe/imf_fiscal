Reinforcing the growth momentum requires the right mix of demand support and supply reforms. In those advanced economies where inflation remains below target, a supportive monetary policy stance should be maintained, relying on unconventional measures, as needed—for example in the euro area and Japan. In the United States, monetary policy normalization should continue to be gradual and data driven. In economies operating close to full capacity (such as the United States and Germany), any fiscal support should be oriented toward increasing potential output, for instance through investment in high-quality infrastructure, including social infrastructure such as education, health, or childcare. In Germany, higher public investment would also contribute to reducing the very high current account balance surplus. In economies with insufficient demand but available fiscal space, fiscal policy can support short-term growth while also focusing on boosting the supply potential of the economy. Emerging economies face starkly diverse cyclical positions, but the emphasis should generally be on enhancing resilience (as discussed below). Exploiting synergies between short-term support and structural reforms is even more crucial where fiscal space is limited and monetary policy operates close to the effective lower bound. In such cases the combination of temporary macroeconomic support—well-anchored by credible medium-term policy frameworks—with growth-enhancing structural reforms can deliver more than the sum of its parts.In countries where fiscal adjustment is needed, consolidation should be gradual and as growth-friendly as possible, while structural reforms should prioritize lower-cost measures that could have a beneficial impact on public finances over the medium-term.
