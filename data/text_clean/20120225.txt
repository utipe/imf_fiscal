Fiscal consolidation, structured and paced to avoid a collapse in demand and ensure debt sustainability, must continue in many euro area countries, and laying out credible medium-term adjustment plans remains an urgent priority in key advanced economies. Near term. Sufficient near-term fiscal adjustment has begun in most advanced economies, including in the euro area. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate freely, provided funding for higher deficits can be secured. Overdoing fiscal adjustment in the short run will undermine activity, diminish popular support for adjustment, and further threaten market confidence. Countries with fiscal space, especially those with very low funding costs, should consider slowing fiscal adjustment in 2012, while maintaining their commitment to a credible medium-term consolidation plan. Euro area members benefiting from a financial assistance program should stick to the agreed consolidation efforts and should fully implement the required structural reforms. Medium term. Policymakers should increase efforts to formulate and implement credible consolidation plans, particularly in the United States and Japan. Depending on circumstances, measures could include entitlement reforms including new health care and pension saving measures, and tax system reforms to boost fiscal revenue. These measures will create policy room to support balance sheet repair, growth, and job creation during this period of heightened vulnerability.
