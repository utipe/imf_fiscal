To avoid over-reliance on monetary policy, near-term fiscal policy should support the recovery where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, focusing on investment. Where public debt is high, commitments to credible medium-term consolidation plans can create policy space. Where necessary, fiscal consolidation should remain growth-friendly and support policies that foster innovation and productivity, while protecting the most vulnerable. In the United States, while the recent bipartisan fiscal agreements was an important positive step, further fiscal efforts are needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium-term as interest rates gradually increase and the demographic transition intensifies. An early agreement on credible medium-term deficit reduction would provide the space to fund investments in infrastructure, to raise productivity and innovation, and enhance workers’ skills. In the euro area, countries with fiscal space should do more to support growth—for example, through infrastructure investment in Germany. Swift implementation—and an expansion—of the EU scheme to provide public and private investment would raise growth in the short and medium-term and have positive spillovers in the region. Temporary costs related to refugee expenditures should generally be accommodated, and the compatibility with current fiscal targets assessed on a case-by-case basis. In Japan, a commitment to fiscal consolidation centered on a pre-announced path of gradual consumption tax hikes and a strengthening of fiscal institutions would create near-term policy space to maintain growth momentum.
