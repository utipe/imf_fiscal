Advanced economies should maintain supportive policies, given still substantial output gaps and below-target inflation. Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, including by increasing infrastructure investment. In many emerging market economies, macroeconomic policy space to support growth remains limited, but lower oil prices will alleviate inflationary pressures, allowing for a more gradual tightening of monetary policy. For oil exporters, the need to adjust fiscal stance would depend on the scope of savings from past higher prices of oil and exchange rate regimes. For countries with less policy space, exchange rate flexibility will be a critical buffer to the shock. Lower oil prices offer an opportunity to reform energy subsidies and taxes in both oil exporters and importers. There is an urgent need for structural reforms to raise potential output in both advanced and emerging economies. Fiscal policy should be growth friendly. The pace and composition of fiscal consolidation should be designed to support both the recovery and long-term growth, including by enhancing infrastructure investment in economies with identified needs, output gaps, and relatively efficient investment processes (for example, Germany, the United States). Where there is space, supportive fiscal stance can bring forward the growth benefits of structural reform by helping offset short-term adverse effects. In the euro area, flexibility within the fiscal governance framework should be used to support key structural reforms and public investment. Finally, credible medium-term consolidation plans remain needed in Japan and the United States.
