Sustainably higher and inclusive growth requires more forceful and comprehensive policies. With multiple interdependent factors holding back growth, policymakers have to work all necessary leversâ€” structural policies (including to promote financial stability and trade), fiscal policies, and monetary policy. Depending on country needs, comprehensive action will combine structural reforms with demand support, anchored by coherent and well-communicated policy frameworks. Where interest rates are at or near their effective lower bounds, fiscal policy must play a larger role. At the same time, policymakers can raise confidence by explaining to citizens the benefits of reform and, where necessary, providing effective support to those who disproportionately shoulder the burden of adjustment. Efforts to advance global trade integration, lower financial stability risks, and address geopolitical spillovers remain vital. Where monetary policy operates near or at the lower bound, growth-friendly fiscal policy has an important role to play. Indeed, a strategy of deploying all available tools can counter damaging perceptions that the policy space to use individual instruments might be limited. Taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment and depending on the availability of fiscal space, there is a case for more public investment. Other helpful measures include adjusting the composition of spending toward public investment and moving the revenue structure toward indirect and other taxes relatively less detrimental to growth. In a number of countries, it may be appropriate to devote fiscal resources to reduce private sector debt overhangs and repair financial sector balance sheets.
