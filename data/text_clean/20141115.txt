Fiscal policy should be growth friendly, with the pace and composition of fiscal adjustment—where needed—attuned to supporting the recovery. Fiscal consolidation should proceed gradually, anchored in credible medium-term plans, which are lacking in some countries (notably Japan and the United States). At the same time, the design of fiscal policy should support growth, including by enhancing infrastructure investment (see Annex) where needs have been identified, there is slack in the economy, and investment processes are relatively efficient (for example, Germany and the United States). When there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, short-run demand effects are stronger, and the boost in output can lead to a decline in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio. Provided that there is space, a supportive fiscal stance can help offset short-term adverse effects of structural reforms on aggregate demand, bringing forward the growth benefits. In response to negative growth surprises in the euro area flexibility within the fiscal governance framework could and should be used where possible to avoid triggering additional consolidation efforts. Finally, the pace of fiscal withdrawal in 2014–15 is broadly appropriate in Japan, but a post-2015 consolidation plan remains needed.
