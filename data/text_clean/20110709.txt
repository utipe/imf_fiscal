Fiscal Policy: Resolve the Sovereign Crisis and Adopt Credible Mediumterm Frameworks A long-term solution to problems in peripheral euro area economies requires a range of measures. In addition to structural policies and temporary financial assistance, front-loaded fiscal adjustment is needed to restore market confidence and ease the pressure on sovereign and bank spreads. The weak growth outlook in Greece and Portugal imply, notably in the presence of financing constraints, the need for fiscal adjustment measures, as agreed in the EC-IMF programs for these economies. For Europe as a whole, further policy measures are needed to address weaknesses in national budgetary institutions and procedures that have undermined past efforts to enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, such as a lack of transparency and medium-term orientation, as well as an optimistic bias in some national official forecasts. Some reforms to overhaul EU governance have been proposed. They need to be legislated and implemented expeditiously. Addressing the fiscal situation in United States and Japan requires balancing short-run growth fragility with long-term sustainability concerns. But authorities should implement credible medium-term fiscal adjustment plans that include entitlement and revenue-raising tax reforms. For the United States, it is critical to immediately raise the debt ceiling.
