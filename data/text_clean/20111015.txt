Credible medium-term fiscal plans, which would create space for providing further support for fledgling recovery, and well calibrated and appropriately paced fiscal adjustment in the near term to anchor investor confidence. This need to be supported by rapid implementation of structural reforms to raise growth and enhance debt sustainability. Fiscal repair: achieve sustainable balances, while supporting growth. Advanced G-20 economies must articulate credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans with specific measures embedded in a realistic macroeconomic framework. This would create more policy space for nearterm support to growth and employment if needed. In the event of a further significant slowdown in growth, a number of these economies have scope to slow their current pace of consolidation, if offset by a commitment of additional tightening later. In the United States, the proposed American Jobs Act would provide needed near-term support. However, parallel and credible medium-term fiscal adjustment plan that raises revenues and contains the growth of entitlement spending remains essential. Japan’s near-term fiscal stance is appropriate given the need to rebuild after the earthquake, but a comprehensive and ambitious plan to put public debt on a sustainable footing over the medium-term remains essential. In most other advanced G-20 economies (for example, Australia, Canada, Germany, Korea, and the United Kingdom), current plans are appropriate, but near-term tightening should also slow if growth threatens to be substantially lower than projected, with compensating stronger medium-term adjustment. Economies facing adverse private funding conditions—such as those with IMFand EU-supported programs—have little choice but to press ahead with current consolidation plans.
