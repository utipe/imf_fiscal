Fiscal consolidation must continue in many euro area economies, but it should be structured and paced to avoid a collapse in demand and growth. Sufficient near-term fiscal adjustment is in train in most economies. Countries should allow automatic stabilizers operate freely, provided they can secure funding for higher deficits. those facing very low funding costs should consider a slower pace of consolidation. Overdoing fiscal adjustment in the short run to counter cyclical revenue losses will undercut activity further, diminish popular support for adjustment, and further undermine market confidence. Countries with policy space might consider slowing structural fiscal adjustment in 2012, while maintaining their commitment to a credible medium-term consolidation plan. In other G-20 advanced economies, there remains an urgent priority to set out a credible path for fiscal consolidation over the medium-term. In the near term, sufficient fiscal adjustment is planned in most advanced economies. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully. in those economies that can afford to do so, the pace of near-term fiscal consolidation should slow. But medium-term risks to the sustainability remain unaddressed. In the United States and Japan, policymakers should redouble efforts to formulate and implement credible medium-term consolidation plans. Measures could include entitlement reforms including new health care and pension saving measures, caps on discretionary spending, and tax system reforms to boost fiscal revenue. Putting in place such plans will also reinforce policy room to support balance sheet repair, growth, and job creation during this period of heightened vulnerability. In the United States, there is a risk that political paralysis could lead to an excessively rapid pace of deficit reduction, including an early expiry of the existing stimulus measures such as the payroll tax cut. Such developments would further undermine the already weak recovery.
