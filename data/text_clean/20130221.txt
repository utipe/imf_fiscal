Fiscal consolidation needs to continue at a gradual and sustained pace. Fiscal adjustment in most advanced economies is broadly appropriate. Fiscal targets should be pursued in structural rather than nominal terms, ensuring that negative growth surprises do not trigger additional consolidation efforts (in the euro area, the current fiscal framework provides sufficient flexibility and should be used appropriately). Countries facing higher debt or greater market pressure are generally adjusting more than their advanced economy peers. In the event of large negative shocks or growth disappointments, the current fiscal policy stance may need to be reassessed in countries that can afford it. Policymakers need to focus on following issues: United States authorities should act early and decisively to find a durable solution to raising the debt ceiling and avert automatic spending cuts. If a resolution is not found, confidence in United States policymakers could rapidly erode, with potentially large spillovers to the rest of the world. Fiscal adjustment must be supported by the adoption and implementation of concrete medium-term consolidation plans. The recently-announced stimulus by Japan makes this even more urgent. Despite progress made so far, United States policymakers should agree on a comprehensive plan that includes both higher revenues and contains entitlement spending. More generally, in advanced economies, growth in public health care spending is on an unsustainable trajectory (with projections indicating increases in net present value terms of close to 100 percent of GDP). Thus, it is important for advanced economies to move early to curtail rising age- and healthrelated spending to ensure debt sustainability.
